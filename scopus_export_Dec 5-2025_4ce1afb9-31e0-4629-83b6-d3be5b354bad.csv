A simplified version of the same algorithm computes the transitive closure of the graph with the same time complexity. The algorithm operates on an (Formula presented.) matrix, performing n inspections and no more than n updates of each matrix cell, until the final matrix is computed. In this paper, we apply a technique called SmartForce, originally devised as a performance enhancement for solving the traveling salesman problem, to avoid the inspection and checking of cells that do not need to be updated, thus reducing the overall computation time when the number, u, of cell updates is substantially smaller than (Formula presented.). When the ratio (Formula presented.) is not small enough, the performance of the proposed procedure might be worse than that of the Floyd–Warshall algorithm. To speed up the algorithm independently of the input instance type, we introduce an effective hybrid approach. Finally, a similar procedure, which exploits suitable fast data structures, can be used to achieve a speedup over the Floyd–Warshall simplified algorithm that computes the transitive closure of a graph. © 2025 by the authors.","all-pairs shortest paths; FastSet data structure; Floyd–Warshall graph algorithm; SmartForce technique; transitive closure","Computational complexity; Graph algorithms; All pairs shortest paths; Fastset data structure; Floyd-warshall; Floyd–warshall graph algorithm; matrix; S-algorithms; Smartforce technique; Time complexity; Transitive closure; Matrix algebra","","","","","","","Floyd, Robert W., Algorithm 97: Shortest path, Communications of the ACM, 5, 6, (1962); Warshall, Stephen, A Theorem on Boolean Matrices, Journal of the ACM, 9, 1, pp. 11-12, (1962); Shortest Path Problem Ninth Dimacs Implementation Challenge, (2009); Shortest Path Network Problems, (1975); Shortest Path Problem Analysis and Comparison of Methods, (2025); A Note on Two Problems in Connexion with Graphs, (2025); Quarterly of Applied Mathematics, (1958); Network Flow Theory, (1956); Combinatorial Optimization Networks and Matroids, (1976); Han, Yijie, An O(n 3(log∈log∈n/log∈n) 5/4) time algorithm for all Pairs shortest path, Algorithmica, 51, 4, pp. 428-434, (2008)","G.

Our goals are to bypass expensive tuning procedures and to ensure a balanced interplay between exploration and exploitation at appropriate stages of the search process. To achieve this, we developed a framework called HHSA that employs Hyper-Heuristics (HHs) and makes use of fixed-temperature SA as their low-level heuristics. The proposed approach is evaluated across three state-of-the-art HHs and four problem domains (i.e., k-Graph Coloring, Permutation Flowshop, Traveling Salesperson, and Facility Location). Comparative results against a fine-tuned SA reveal that HHSA consistently achieves comparable or superior results in three out of the four studied problems. The findings reinforce the broader applicability of hyper-heuristics, demonstrating their potential to generalize across different problem domains without relying on instance-specific configurations. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Integrating clinical and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) variables using deep learning could improve prediction. Methods: We retrospectively analysed 538 men who underwent MRI and biopsy between April 2019-September 2024. A fully connected neural network was trained using 5-fold cross-validation. Model 1 included clinical features (age, prostate-specific antigen [PSA], PSA density, digital rectal examination, family history, prior negative biopsy, and ongoing therapy). Model 2 used MRI-derived Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) categories. Model 3 used all previous variables as well as lesion size, location, and prostate volume as determined on MRI. Results: Model 3 achieved the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC = 0.822), followed by Model 2 (AUC = 0.778) and Model 1 (AUC = 0.716). Sensitivities for detecting clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) were 87.4%, 91.6%, and 86.8% for Models 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Although Model 3 had slightly lower sensitivity than Model 2, it showed higher specificity, reducing false positives and avoiding 43.4% and 21.2% more biopsies compared to Models 1 and 2. Decision curve analysis showed M2 had the highest net benefit at risk thresholds ≤ 20%, while M3 was superior above 20%. Conclusions: Model 3 improved csPCa risk stratification, particularly in biopsy-averse settings, while Model 2 was more effective in cancer-averse scenarios. These models support personalized, context-sensitive biopsy decisions. © 2025 by the authors.","artificial intelligence; biopsy; magnetic resonance imaging; prostate neoplasms","alpha adrenergic receptor blocking agent; prostate specific antigen; scopolamine butyl bromide; tamsulosin; accuracy; adult; aged; area under the curve; Article; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; clinical feature; controlled study; cross validation; deep learning; diagnostic test accuracy study; digital rectal examination; dynamic contrast enhanced imaging; dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging; entropy; ethnicity; false positive result; family history; human; human tissue; lesion volume; machine learning; major clinical study; male; middle aged; nerve cell network; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; prediction; predictive value; prostate biopsy; prostate cancer; prostate imaging reporting and data system; prostate tumor; prostate volume; receiver operating characteristic; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; training","","scopolamine butyl bromide, 149-64-4, 7182-53-8, 73156-19-1; tamsulosin, 106133-20-4, 106138-88-9, 106463-17-6, 80223-99-0, 94666-07-6","Achieva, Philips Healthcare; Aera, Siemens Healtheneers; Aplio 300 ultrasound, Canon; MedCalc Statistical Software version 23.1.3, MedCalc; Stata version 19.5, StataCorp","Philips Healthcare; Siemens Healtheneers; Canon; MedCalc; StataCorp","","","Cornford, Philip A., EAU-EANM-ESTRO-ESUR-ISUP-SIOG Guidelines on Prostate Cancer—2024 Update.

Predicting these equilibria often requires comprehensive thermodynamic models, yet simplified approaches can provide valuable perspectives. In this work, we explore the application of the Bragg–Williams model to solid–liquid equilibria in binary mixtures leading to the formation of eutectic solvents. This model relies on a single parameter—the molar energy change upon mixing compounds—and demonstrates noteworthy features: the parameter can be estimated from a few (in principle, from a single) experimental melting points, and it correlates strongly with interaction energy parameters from more complex models, such as the PC-SAFT molecular-based equation of state. By using the Bragg–Williams model, we provide a straightforward and informative framework for characterizing solid–liquid equilibria, enabling insights into molecular interactions while requiring few data points as input. Despite its simplicity, the model effectively captures the essence of binary mixture energetics, positioning it as a practical tool for advancing the understanding of phase behavior in eutectic solvent systems. © 2025 by the authors.","binary mixtures; Bragg–Williams; eutectic solvents","deep eutectic solvent; solvent; Article; Bragg Williams model; energy transfer; liquid; melting point; model; molecular interaction; nonhuman; thermodynamics; chemical model; chemistry; phase transition; Models, Chemical; Phase Transition; Solvents; Thermodynamics","","Solvents","","","(2021RTDA46_02B2_DMIF, DOT215B2RJ)","M.A.S. and O.O. are supported by the Italian Ministry of the University and the Research via the research program PON 2014-2020 AZIONE IV.6 GREEN, project numbers 2021RTDA46_02B2_DMIF and DOT215B2RJ, respectively.","Abbott, Andrew P., Deep Eutectic Solvents formed between choline chloride and carboxylic acids: Versatile alternatives to ionic liquids, Journal of the American Chemical Society, 126, 29, pp. 9142-9147, (2004); Smith, Emma L., Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs) and Their Applications, Chemical Reviews, 114, 21, pp. 11060-11082, (2014); Hansen, Benworth Bryce, Deep Eutectic Solvents: A Review of Fundamentals and Applications, Chemical Reviews, 121, 3, pp. 1232-1285, (2021); A Compend of Materia Medica Therapeutics and Prescription Writing with Especial Reference to the Physiological Actions of Drugs 6th Ed, (1894); Alkhatib, Ismail I.I., Perspectives and guidelines on thermodynamic modelling of deep eutectic solvents, Journal of Molecular Liquids, 298, (2020); Kovács, Attila, Modeling the Physicochemical Properties of Natural Deep Eutectic Solvents, ChemSusChem, 13, 15, pp. 3789-3804, (2020); Chen, Yuh Jen, Forecasting corporate credit ratings using big data from social media, Expert Systems with Applications, 207, (2022); Fajar, Adroit T.N., Estimating the phase diagrams of deep eutectic solvents within an extensive chemical space, Communications Chemistry, 7, 1, (2024); Alhadid, Ahmad, Modeling of solid–liquid equilibria in deep eutectic solvents: A parameter study, Molecules, 24, 12, (2019); Kollau, Laura J.B.M., Activity modelling of the solid-liquid equilibrium of deep eutectic solvents, Pure and Applied Chemistry, 91, 8, pp. 1341-1349, (2019)","F.

The study employed a quantitative research design, utilizing questionnaire to gather data from a sample of teachers. The findings indicate that there are differences in the subtopics and concepts that teachers prioritize when teaching about the properties of matter, as well as in the methods and techniques they use. The study also found that there was a significant difference in the perspectives of teachers based on the country they worked in, but no significant difference was observed in the practices of teachers based on the country and school they worked in. These findings suggest that the country in which a teacher works has a greater impact on their perspectives on teaching the properties of matter than the level of school they work in. Future research may explore additional factors or variables that could influence teachers' perspectives and practices on teaching the properties of matter in different countries. © 2025 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Earlier converse results focus on switched systems with dwell-time constraints only, and the resulting inequalities depend on the flow of individual subsystems. With the help of a counterexample, we show that a lower bound that guarantees stability for dwell-time switching signals may not necessarily imply stability for switching signals with same lower bound on the average dwell-time. Based on these two observations, we provide a converse result for the average dwell-time constrained systems in terms of inequalities which do not depend on the flow of individual subsystems and are easier to check. The particular case of linear switched systems is studied as a corollary to our main result. © The authors.

Implicit solvent models are widely used to describe electrostatics and complementarity at interfaces. Electrostatic complementarity at the interface is not trivial, involving surface potentials rather than the charges of surfacial contacting atoms. (2) Results: The program bluues_cplx, here used in conjunction with the software NanoShaper to compute molecular surfaces, has been used to compute the electrostatic properties of 756 protein–protein and 189 protein–ligand complexes along with the corresponding isolated molecules. (3) Methods: The software we make available here uses Generalized Born (GB) radii, computed by a molecular surface integral, to output several descriptors of electrostatics at protein (and in general, molecular) interfaces. We illustrate the usage of the software by analyzing a dataset of protein–protein and protein–ligand complexes, thus extending and refining previous analyses of electrostatic complementarity at protein interfaces. (4) Conclusions: The complete analysis of a molecular complex is performed in tens of seconds on a PC, and the results include the list of surfacial contacting atoms, their charges and Pearson correlation coefficient, the list of contacting surface points with the electrostatic potential (computed for the isolated molecules) and Pearson correlation coefficient, the electrostatic and hydrophobic free energy with different contributions for the isolated molecules, their complex and the difference for all terms. The software is readily usable for any molecular complex in solution. © 2025 by the authors.","bluues; complex; electrostatics; free energy; ligand; protein; software","ligand; protein; protein binding; chemical phenomena; chemistry; molecular model; software; static electricity; Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions; Ligands; Models, Molecular; Protein Binding; Proteins; Software; Static Electricity","","protein, 67254-75-5; Ligands; Proteins","","","European Commission, EC; (2021RTDA46_02B2_); (DOT215B2RJ)","This research was funded by are supported by the Italian Ministry of the University and the Research via the research program PON 2014-2020 AZIONE IV.6 GREEN, project numbers 2021RTDA46_02B2_DMIF (Miguel Angel Soler) and DOT215B2RJ (Ozge Ozkilinc).

WDF principles allow us to implement circuits with one nonlinearity in an explicit fashion, by properly setting the free parameters that are introduced in the Wave Digital (WD) domain. Although this property does not extend to the WDF realization of circuits with multiple nonlinearities, which instead requires the use of iterative solvers, a proper setting of the free parameters is beneficial also in these cases, in terms of both robustness and efficiency of the implementation. In particular, recent research shows that a common optimal policy for the setting of free parameters can be adopted when either a WD fixed-point method or a WD Newton-Raphson (NR) method is used to solve the same nonlinear circuit. In this work, we present a class of WD extended fixed-point solvers with order from zero to infinity that generalizes the aforementioned iterative methods; the zero-order case corresponds to the existent WD fixed-point method, while the infinite-order case to WD NR. The proposed solvers do not require to compute inverse Jacobian matrices and are characterized by superlinear speed of convergence. Moreover, we show that the very same policy of free parameter setting can be applied independently of the order, causing, in any case, an increase of robustness and convergence speed. © 2024 IEEE.","circuit simulation; extended fixed-point solvers; iterative methods; Wave digital filters","Bandpass filters; Digital filters; Inverse problems; Newton-Raphson method; Nonlinear filtering; Analog models; Audio circuits; Extended fixed-point solver; Filter theory; Fixed points; Fixed-points method; Free parameters; Nonlinear digital filters; Virtual analogs; Wave digital filters; Jacobian matrices","","","","","","","Z̈olzer, Udo, DAFX: Digital Audio Effects: Second Edition, (2011); Ducceschi, Michele, Non-Iterative Simulation Methods for Virtual Analog Modelling, IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio Speech and Language Processing, 30, pp. 3189-3198, (2022); Bernardini, Alberto, A Wave Digital Newton-Raphson Method for Virtual Analog Modeling of Audio Circuits with Multiple One-Port Nonlinearities, IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio Speech and Language Processing, 29, pp. 2162-2173, (2021); Giampiccolo, Riccardo, A QUADRIC SURFACE MODEL OF VACUUM TUBES FOR VIRTUAL ANALOG APPLICATIONS, Proceedings of the International Conference on Digital Audio Effects, DAFx, pp. 296-303, (2023); Dafx, (2019); Hélie, Thomas, Volterra series and state transformation for real-time simulations of audio circuits including saturations: Application to the moog ladder filter, IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing, 18, 4, pp. 747-759, (2010); Borin, Gianpaolo, Elimination of delay-free loops in discrete-time models of nonlinear acoustic systems, IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing, 8, 5, pp. 597-604, (2000); Falaize, Antoine, Simulation of an analog circuit of a wah pedal: A port-hamiltonian approach, pp. 548-556, (2013); Falaize, Antoine, Passive simulation of the nonlinear port-Hamiltonian modeling of a Rhodes Piano, Journal of Sound and Vibration, 390, pp. 289-309, (2017); Fettweis, Alfred, Wave Digital Filters: Theory and Practice, Proceedings of the IEEE, 74, 2, pp. 270-327, (1986)","A.

It happens when undesired materials build up on the reactor surfaces, decreasing the effectiveness of heat transfer and raising operating expenses. It is possible to avoid excessive accumulation, enhance reactor performance, and more efficiently schedule maintenance by accurately forecasting the fouling factor over time. In order to predict the fouling factor using time series data, we created a fusion-based deep learning model in this study that incorporates LSTM, GRU, and Attention mechanism. The proposed model is designed to capture both long-term dependencies and shortterm variations, while the Attention mechanism helps focus on critical time steps. Using actual data from a PE-EVA industrial plant from Versalis SpA, we trained and evaluated the model. The results showed strong performance, with an R2 score of 0.87, MSE of 4.74 10-3, RMSE of 0.04691, and SMAPE of 12.53%. Our model outperformed the traditional time series models. These findings show that combining different deep learning models improves the accuracy and reliability of fouling factor forecasts. © 2025 ISIF.","Fouling Factor; Fusion Model; Neural Networks; Polymerization; Time Series Forecasting","Data fusion; Forecasting; Fouling; Industrial plants; Information fusion; Learning systems; Long short-term memory; Time series; Attention mechanisms; Attention model; Fouling factor; Fusion model; Learning models; Neural-networks; Polymer production; Production plant; Thermoplastic polymer; Time series forecasting; Polymerization","","","","","European Commission, EU; (117/2023)","This work was funded by Versalis S.p.A. and by the European Union - NextGenerationEU, National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) M4C2 Inv. 3.3 D.M. 117/2023.

This work focuses on a specific form of constraint, the so-called table constraint, used to specify conditions on the values of variables as an enumeration of alternative options. Since every condition on a set of finite domain variables can be ultimately expressed as a finite set of cases, Table can, in principle, simulate any other constraint. These characteristics make Table one of the most studied constraints ever, leading to a series of increasingly efficient propagation algorithms. Despite this, it is not uncommon to encounter real-world problems with hundreds or thousands of valid cases that are simply too many to be handled effectively with standard CPU-based approaches. In this paper, we deal with the Compact-Table (CT) algorithm, the state-of-the-art propagation algorithms for Table. We describe how CT can be enhanced by exploiting the massive computational power offered by modern Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to handle large Table constraints. In particular, we report on the design and implementation of GPU-accelerated CT, on its integration into an existing constraint solver, and on an experimental validation performed on a significant set of instances. © The Author(s), 2025.

We contend that a good trade-off between two primary measures of the complexity of the representation, which are the number of unknowns and the degree of the polynomial D, should aim at the transparency of the representation. Our work builds on a previous construction, notably that of M. Carl and B.Z. Moroz, who have provided a Diophantine representation of the sentences provable in the Gödel-Bernays class theory (NBG) within first-order predicate calculus. In contrast, our Diophantine representation of NBG relies on a modernized version of Schröder’s algebra of relations, specifically the ℒ× equational calculus proposed by A. Tarski and S. Givant. Additionally, we replace NBG’s traditional axioms with an alternative axiomatization by H. Friedmann. These changes reduce the complexity of the Diophantine representation of NBG’s provability, while maintaining equivalence to more classical formalizations. While we provide only preliminary insights into this novel equational axiomatization, we report on initial experiments with these axioms using the Vampire theorem prover. © 2025 Copyright for this paper by its authors.","Algebraic logic; Class theory; Diophantine sets","Formal logic; Polynomials; Theorem proving; Algebraic logic; Axiomati-sation; Axiomatics; Class theory; Diophantine equation; Diophantine set; Formal theory; Recursively enumerable sets; Robinson; Trade off; Economic and social effects","","","","","","","Introduction to Metamathematics, (1952); Annals of Mathematics, (1961); Soviet Math Dokl, (1970); Hilbert S Tenth Problem, (1993); J Symbolic Logic, (1982); Carl, Merlin, On a Diophantine Representation of the Predicate of Provability, Journal of Mathematical Sciences (United States), 199, 1, pp. 36-52, (2014); Introduction to Mathematical Logic, (1997); A Formalization of Set Theory Without Variables, (1987); Simplified Axioms for Class Theory, (2020); Gödel, Kurt, Über formal unentscheidbare Sätze der Principia Mathematica und verwandter Systeme I, Monatshefte fur Mathematik, 38, 1, pp. 173-198, (1931)","A.

A matching is stable if no man and woman prefer each other over their assigned partners. The Gale-Shapley algorithm is the classical polynomial-time solution to this problem. In Constraint Programming (CP), the Stable Marriage Constraint (SMC) encapsulates this problem as a global constraint, with a consistency-enforcing propagator derived from an extended version of the Gale-Shapley algorithm. In this paper, we present a GPU-accelerated propagator for the SMC and its integration into a CP solver.

Findings from the interviews show that some teachers do not have sufficient knowledge about the properties of matter and their roles in physics. Teachers often focus on the phase or state of properties of matter, but they emphasize the need to clarify the nature and relationship between the fundamental properties of matter. Although they state that understanding the properties of matter forms the basis of science education, they cannot provide sufficient examples of how and in what way it should be taught.

Based on a qualitative approach and 15 in-depth interviews with different stakeholders involved in the early development of the pilot network, the analysis focuses on the dynamics of collaboration between the actors involved that led to the creation of the Italian participatory environmental monitoring platform. For the analysis, we adopt the theoretical model of ‘translation' proposed by Michel Callon (1984), which focuses on the dynamics of the emergence of a network of collaboration between scientists and other heterogeneous actors. In particular, we focus on the notion of ‘obligatory passage point’ (OPP) along the translation process. Focusing on the process of translation and the dynamics that characterise the convergence towards a common OPP in the processes of network constitution and knowledge production highlights some crucial dynamics that support the unfolding of effective forms of participatory co-production, including: the understanding of how the roles and identities of different actors are recognised, transformed, productively aligned and consolidated; the performative power of participatory processes that are able to redefine and transform the pre-existing identities and roles of actors; and the outcome of the epistemic inclusion of practices and knowledge of less powerful actors within institutional, political and scientific frameworks. © 2024 Process Press.","Actor Network Theory; Knowledge co-production; obligatory passage point (OPP); participatory environmental monitoring; sociology of translation","","","","","","Fondazione Cariplo; Politecnico di Milano; Università degli Studi di Padova, UNIPD; Università degli Studi di Trieste, UniTS","This work was supported by the Fondazione Cariplo (Milan) and was part of the national research project \u2018ENRRI\u2013Enhancing Responsible Research and Innovation\u2019 (2020\u20132023), led by the Politecnico di Milano and participated by the University of Padova and the University of Trieste.

RSs interact with the environment through a sequence of sets of entities called the context. In this work, we introduce ccReact, a novel interaction language for implementing and verifying RSs. ccReact extends the classical RS model by allowing the specification of recursive, nondeterministic, and conditional context sequences, thus enhancing the interactive capabilities of the models. We provide a rewriting logic (RL) semantics for ccReact, making it executable in the Maude system. We prove that our RL embedding is sound and complete, thereby offering a robust tool for analyzing RSs. Our methods enable various formal analysis techniques for RSs, including simulation of RSs interacting with ccReact processes, verification of reachability properties, model checking of temporal (LTL and CTL) formulas, and exploring the system evolution through a graphical tool to better understand its behavior. We apply our methods to analyze RSs from different domains, including computer science and biological systems.

Computational methods have the potential to accelerate this process, reducing costs and time, but only if they demonstrate broad applicability and efficiency in exploring mutations, evaluating affinity, and pruning unproductive mutation paths. Results: In response to these challenges, we introduce a new computational platform for optimizing protein binders towards their targets. The platform is organized as a series of modules, performing mutation selection and application, molecular dynamics simulations to sample conformations around interaction poses, and mutation prioritization using suitable scoring functions. Notably, the platform supports parallel exploration of different mutation streams, enabling in silico high-throughput screening on High Performance Computing (HPC) systems. Furthermore, the platform is highly customizable, allowing users to implement their own protocols.

In the usual applications of this method, one has to evaluate the derivative of h≡g−1. This can be a straightforward procedure when g is invertible, while difficulties may arise when g is non-invertible. The RVT method has received a great deal of attention in the recent years, because of its crucial relevance in many applications. In the present work we introduce a new approach which allows to determine the probability density function μ<inf>Y</inf> of the RV Y=g(X), when g is non-invertible due to its non-bijective nature. The main interest of our approach is that it can be easily implemented, from the numerical point of view, but mostly because of its low computational cost, which makes it very competitive. As a proof of concept, we apply our method to some numerical examples related to random differential equations, as well as discrete mappings, all of them of interest in the domain of applied Physics. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Applications; Density function; Distribution function; Non-invertible random transformation; Numerical simulations; Ordinary differential equations; Random differential equations; Random variable transformation","Distribution functions; Numerical methods; Ordinary differential equations; Random variables; Distribution-functions; Foldings; Fundamental tools; New approaches; Non-invertible random transformation; Probability distribution functions; Random differential equations; Random variable transformation techniques; Random variable transformations; Transformation methods; Probability density function","","","","","","","Random Dynamical Systems, (1998); Random Differential Equations in Science and Engineering, (1973); Balibrea-Iniesta, Francisco, Recent developments in dynamical systems: Three perspectives, International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos, 20, 9, pp. 2591-2636, (2010); Probability Random Variables and Stochastic Processes, (1991); Probability Essentials, (2003); Casabán, M.

Due to recent advances in decentralized machine learning in Federated Learning (FL), each hospital has its own private data and learning models to collaborate with other trusted participating hospitals. Heterogeneous data and models among different hospitals raise major challenges in robust FL, such as gradient leakage, where participants can exploit model weights to infer data. Here, we proposed a robust FL method to efficiently tackle data and model heterogeneity, where we train our model using knowledge distillation and a novel weighted client confidence score on hematological cytomorphology data in clinical settings. In the knowledge distillation, each participant learns from other participants by a weighted confidence score so that knowledge from clean models is distributed other than the noisy clients possessing noisy data. Moreover, we use symmetric loss to reduce the negative impact of data heterogeneity and label diversity by reducing overfitting the model to noisy labels. In comparison to the current approaches, our proposed method performs the best, and this is the first demonstration of addressing both data and model heterogeneity in end-to-end FL that lays the foundation for robust FL in laboratories and clinical applications. © 2024 World Scientific Publishing Company.","collaborative machine learning; data and model heterogeneity; knowledge distillation; noisy label learning; Robust federated learning","Distillation; Machine learning; Sensitive data; Clinical settings; Collaborative machine learning; Data and model heterogeneity; Heterogeneous data; Heterogeneous modelling; Knowledge distillation; Machine-learning; Noisy label learning; Noisy labels; Robust federated learning; Hospitals; article; cell structure; data privacy; distillation; drug therapy; human; learning; machine learning; Humans; Machine Learning; Mental Processes","","","","","","This work was partially supported by the Departmental Strategic Plan (PSD) of the University of Udine - Interdepartmental Project on Artificial Intelligence (2020-25) and by the Italian Minister of Defense PNRM project a2021-096 ""ARGOS"" (2023- 2025).","Communication Efficient Learning of Deep Networks from Decentralized Data, (2016); Ortiz, Andrés, Ensembles of Deep Learning Architectures for the Early Diagnosis of the Alzheimer's Disease, International Journal of Neural Systems, 26, 7, (2016); Ding, Xin, Compact Convolutional Neural Network with Multi-Headed Attention Mechanism for Seizure Prediction, International Journal of Neural Systems, 33, 3, (2023); Madni, Hussain Ahmad, Swarm-FHE: Fully Homomorphic Encryption-based Swarm Learning for Malicious Clients, International Journal of Neural Systems, 33, 8, (2023); Rafiei, Mohammad Hossein, A New Neural Dynamic Classification Algorithm, IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, 28, 12, pp. 3074-3083, (2017); Pereira, Danillo Roberto, FEMa: a finite element machine for fast learning, Neural Computing and Applications, 32, 10, pp. 6393-6404, (2020); Alam, Kazi Md Rokibul, A dynamic ensemble learning algorithm for neural networks, Neural Computing and Applications, 32, 12, pp. 8675-8690, (2020); Rafiei, Mohammad Hossein, Self-Supervised Learning for Electroencephalography, IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, 35, 2, pp. 1457-1471, (2024); Mousavi, Seyed Milad, Modeling the efficacy of different anti-angiogenic drugs on treatment of solid tumors using 3D computational modeling and machine learning, Computers in Biology and Medicine, 146, (2022); Mosavi, Amir H., Deep learning fuzzy immersion and invariance control for type-I diabetes, Computers in Biology and Medicine, 149, (2022)","G.L.

To tackle this problem, we propose the use of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for the purpose of learning complex target dynamics. Following the recent advances in state estimation provided by KalmanNet, a neural network-aided Kalman Filter, the proposed approach aims to exploit its tracking performance in a multiple model schema to compensate for model mismatch across maneuvers, leading to a more prompt response to motion switches.

In RSs interaction with the environment is modeled by a linear sequence of sets of entities called context. In this paper, we present a new interaction language, called ccReact  for implementing and specifying RSs. ccReact extends the classic RS computational model by allowing the specification of possibly recursive, nondeterministic conditional context sequences, enhancing the interactive capabilities of the models. We provide a rewriting logic semantics for ccReact, making it executable in the Maude system. This enables the simulation and the verification of (reachability) properties, and model checking temporal (LTL and CTL) formulas for our extended RSs.

A popular approach to address the lack of training data in other domains is to rely on transfer learning to transfer the knowledge learned from a large-scale, general-purpose dataset (e.g. ImageNet) to a domain-specific task. However, this approach has been shown to lead to unsatisfactory results when the target task is completely unrelated to the data employed for the pre-training process, which is the case when working on document layout analysis. For this reason, in the present paper, we provide an overview of domain-specific transfer learning for document layout segmentation. In particular, we show how relying on document-related images for the pre-training process leads to consistently improved performance and faster convergence compared to training from scratch or even relying on a large, general purpose, dataset such as ImageNet. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","Document Layout Analysis; Fine Tuning Approach; Page Segmentation","Image analysis; Image enhancement; Large datasets; Learning systems; Quality control; Semantic Segmentation; Document layout analysis; Domain specific; Fine tuning; Fine tuning approach; Learning strategy; Page segmentation; Performance; Pre-training; Training process; Transfer learning; Semantics","","","","","","Acknowledgements.

In real-world applications such as hospitals and industries, FL counters the challenges of data heterogeneity and model heterogeneity as an inevitable part of the collaborative training. More specifically, different organizations, such as hospitals, have their own private data and customized models for local training. To the best of our knowledge, the existing methods do not effectively address both problems of model heterogeneity and data heterogeneity in FL. In this paper, we exploit the data and model heterogeneity simultaneously, and propose a method, MDH-FL (Exploiting Model and Data Heterogeneity in FL) to solve such problems to enhance the efficiency of the global model in FL. We use knowledge distillation and a symmetric loss to minimize the heterogeneity and its impact on the model performance. Knowledge distillation is used to solve the problem of model heterogeneity, and symmetric loss tackles with the data and label heterogeneity. We evaluate our method on the medical datasets to conform the real-world scenario of hospitals, and compare with the existing methods. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over the other existing methods. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","Federated Learning; Heterogeneous Data; Heterogeneous Model; Medical Imaging","Distillation; Learning systems; Medical imaging; Central servers; Collaborative learning; Data heterogeneity; Federated learning; Heterogeneous data; Heterogeneous modelling; Machine learning methods; Multiple clients; Real-world; Symmetrics; Hospitals","","","","","","Acknowledgements.

Molecular dynamics simulations of the end-points of a process provide in a straightforward way the enthalpy as an ensemble average. Obtaining absolute entropies is still an open problem and most commonly pathway methods are used to obtain free energy changes and thereafter entropy changes. The kth nearest neighbor (kNN) method has been first proposed as a general method for entropy estimation in the mathematical community 20 years ago. Later, it has been applied to compute conformational, positional–orientational, and hydration entropies of molecules. Programs to compute entropies from molecular ensembles, for example, from molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories, based on the kNN method, are currently available. The kNN method has distinct advantages over traditional methods, namely that it is possible to address high-dimensional spaces, impossible to treat without loss of resolution or drastic approximations with, for example, histogram-based methods. Application of the method requires understanding the features of: the kth nearest neighbor method for entropy estimation; the variables relevant to biomolecular and in general molecular processes; the metrics associated with such variables; the practical implementation of the method, including requirements and limitations intrinsic to the method; and the applications for conformational, position/orientation and solvation entropy. Coupling the method with general approximations for the multivariable entropy based on mutual information, it is possible to address high dimensional problems like those involving the conformation of proteins, nucleic acids, binding of molecules and hydration.

The results revealed that the binding of cholesterol to CDs was spontaneous and thermodynamically favorable, with van der Waals interactions playing a dominant role, while Coulombic interactions have a negligible contribution. The solubility of cholesterol/βCD and cholesterol/MβCD complexes was lower compared to cholesterol/2HPβCD complex due to stronger vdW and Coulombic repulsion between water and CDs. Hydrogen bonding was found to have a minor role in the binding process. The investigation of mechanisms and kinetics of binding demonstrated that cholesterol permeates into the CD cavities completely. Replicas consideration indicated that while the binding to 2HPβCD occurred perpendicularly and solely through positioning cholesterol's oxygen toward the primary hydroxyl rim (PHR), the mechanism of cholesterol binding to βCD and MβCD could take place with the orientation of oxygen towards both rims. Functionalization resulted in decreased cavity polarity, increased constriction tendency, and altered solubility and configuration of the carrier. Upon cholesterol binding, the CDs expanded, increasing the cavity volume in cholesterol-containing systems. The effects of cholesterol on the relative shape anisotropy (κ 2) and asphericity parameter (b) in cyclodextrins were investigated. βCD exhibited a spherical structure regardless of cholesterol presence, while 2HPβCD and MβCD displayed more pronounced non-sphericity in the absence of cholesterol. Loading cholesterol transformed 2HPβCD and MβCD into more spherical shapes, with increased probabilities of higher κ 2. MβCD showed a higher maximum peak of κ 2 compared to 2HPβCD after cholesterol loading, while 2HPβCD maintained a significant maximum peak at 0.2 for b. © 2023, The Author(s).","","beta cyclodextrin derivative; cholesterol; cyclodextrin; oxygen; chemistry; metabolism; molecular dynamics; solubility; thermodynamics; beta-Cyclodextrins; Cholesterol; Cyclodextrins; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Oxygen; Solubility; Thermodynamics","","cholesterol, 57-88-5; cyclodextrin, 12619-70-4; oxygen, 7782-44-7; beta-Cyclodextrins; Cholesterol; Cyclodextrins; Oxygen","","","","","MacH, François, 2019 ESC/EAS guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemias: Lipid modification to reduce cardiovascular risk, Atherosclerosis, 290, pp. 140-205, (2019); Snip, Olga S.C., 2-Hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin Treatment Does Not Induce Atherosclerotic Lesion Regression in Western-Type Diet-Fed Apolipoprotein E Knockout Mice, Biomolecules, 12, 9, (2022); Zhu, Mengmeng, Hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin inhibits the development of triple negative breast cancer by enhancing antitumor immunity, International Immunopharmacology, 125, (2023); Boehler, Nathalie, Antilithiasic effect of β-cyclodextrin in LPN hamster: Comparison with cholestyramine, Journal of Lipid Research, 40, 4, pp. 726-734, (1999); Singh, Rajesh K., High-density lipoprotein or cyclodextrin extraction of cholesterol from aggregated LDL reduces foam cell formation, Journal of Cell Science, 132, 23, (2019); Zidovetzki, Raphael, Use of cyclodextrins to manipulate plasma membrane cholesterol content: Evidence, misconceptions and control strategies, Biochimica et Biophysica Acta - Biomembranes, 1768, 6, pp. 1311-1324, (2007); Mahjoubin-Tehran, Maryam, Cyclodextrins: Potential therapeutics against atherosclerosis, Pharmacology and Therapeutics, 214, (2020); Frijlink, Henderik W., The Effect of Parenterally Administered Cyclodextrins on Cholesterol Levels in the Rat, Pharmaceutical Research, 8, 1, pp. 9-16, (1991); Park, Byung-sung, Effects of dietary β-cyclodextrin on plasma lipid and tissue cholesterol content in swine, Asian-Australasian Journal of Animal Sciences, 20, 1, pp. 100-105, (2007); Coisne, Caroline, β-cyclodextrins decrease cholesterol release and ABC-associated transporter expression in smooth muscle cells and aortic endothelial cells, Frontiers in Physiology, 7, MAY, (2016)","M.

This paper focuses on user perception of the virtual source position and the impact of different out-of-the-box user tracking and head orientation methods made available by iPad's Augmented Reality (AR) camera tracking system and AirPods Pro. We propose an experimental procedure to rank tracking approaches according to perceived accuracy in positioning eye-level and ground-level virtual audio sources compared to real source references. To correctly provide a plausible AAR scenario, the proposed consumer electronic setup simulates a virtual sound source employing the scattering delay network (SDN) algorithm for calibrated dynamic auralisation and customized head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) for personalized user acoustics. The natural listening experience of real sound sources leverages AirPods's active signal processing algorithms for headphone hear-through capabilities. The main result of this study lies in observing an accommodation effect by users interacting with different tracking approaches and sound source positions. In summary, participants tend to prefer more stable tracking solutions despite accuracy and wide head movement range. © 2023 ACM.","Augumented reality; Earables.; Sonic interactions in virtual environments; Spatial audio; User tracking; Virtual Acoustics","Acoustic generators; Audio acoustics; Signal processing; Virtual reality; Audio augmented reality; Augumented reality; Earables.; Sonic interaction in virtual environment; Sonic interactions; Source position; Spatial audio; Tracking approaches; User tracking; Virtual acoustics; Augmented reality","","","","","","","Agus, Natalie, Minimally simple binaural room modeling using a single feedback delay network, AES: Journal of the Audio Engineering Society, 66, 10, pp. 791-807, (2018); Aijaz, Adnan, Demystifying the performance of Bluetooth mesh: Experimental evaluation and optimization, IFIP Wireless Days, 2021-June, (2021); Allen, Jont B., Image method for efficiently simulating small-room acoustics, Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 65, 4, pp. 943-950, (1979); Master Handbook of Acoustics, (2001); Arena, Fabio, An Overview of Augmented Reality, Computers, 11, 2, (2022); Begault, Durand R., Direct comparison of the impact of head tracking, reverberation, and individualized head-related transfer functions on the spatial perception of a virtual speech source, AES: Journal of the Audio Engineering Society, 49, 10, pp. 904-916, (2001); Spatial Hearing the Psychophysics of Human Sound Localization, (1997); Brinkmann, Fabian, On the authenticity of individual dynamic binaural synthesis, Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 142, 4, pp. 1784-1795, (2017); Brinkmann, Fabian, Audibility and Interpolation of Head-Above-Torso Orientation in Binaural Technology, IEEE Journal on Selected Topics in Signal Processing, 9, 5, pp. 931-942, (2015); Daugintis, Rapolas, Classifying Non-Individual Head-Related Transfer Functions with A Computational Auditory Model: Calibration And Metrics, Proceedings - ICASSP, IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, 2023-June, (2023)","","","Association for Computing Machinery","coolshop; Department of Computer Science, University of Torino; DNDG; Pro Logic Informatica; Reply; University of Torino","15th Biannual Conference of the Italian SIGCHI Chapter: Crossing HCI and AI, CHItaly 2023","2023-09-20 through 2023-09-22","Hybrid, Torino","192852","","9798400701122; 9798400708060","","","English","ACM Int.

However, data sensitivity is the main concern for privacy when collaborative training requires data sharing. A neural network, especially Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), is able to reproduce the original data from model parameters, i.e. gradient leakage problem. To solve this problem, SL provides a framework for secure aggregation using blockchain methods. In this paper, we consider the scenario of compromised and malicious participants in the SL environment, where a participant can manipulate the privacy of other participant in collaborative training. We propose a method, Swarm-FHE, Swarm Learning with Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), to encrypt the model parameters before sharing with the participants which are registered and authenticated by blockchain technology. Each participant shares the encrypted parameters (i.e. ciphertexts) with other participants in SL training. We evaluate our method with training of the convolutional neural networks on the CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets. On the basis of a considerable number of experiments and results with different hyperparameter settings, our method performs better as compared to other existing methods. © 2023 World Scientific Publishing Company.","federated learning; fully homomorphic encryption; gradient leakage; Swarm learning","Blockchain; Cryptography; Generative adversarial networks; Learning systems; Block-chain; Collaborative modeling; Collaborative training; Distributed models; Federated learning; Fully homomorphic encryption; Gradient leakage; Model training; Modeling parameters; Swarm learning; Swarm intelligence; artificial neural network; computer security; human; Computer Security; Humans; Neural Networks, Computer","","","","","","","Tian, Yingjie, Recent advances on loss functions in deep learning for computer vision, Neurocomputing, 497, pp. 129-158, (2022); Ortiz, Andrés, Ensembles of Deep Learning Architectures for the Early Diagnosis of the Alzheimer's Disease, International Journal of Neural Systems, 26, 7, (2016); Ding, Xin, Compact Convolutional Neural Network with Multi-Headed Attention Mechanism for Seizure Prediction, International Journal of Neural Systems, 33, 3, (2023); Ahmed, Shamima, Artificial intelligence and machine learning in finance: A bibliometric review, Research in International Business and Finance, 61, (2022); Warnat-Herresthal, Stefanie, Swarm Learning for decentralized and confidential clinical machine learning, Nature, 594, 7862, pp. 265-270, (2021); Nat Med, (2022); Agarwal, Sonali, Deep Learning-based Sentiment Analysis: Establishing Customer Dimension as the Lifeblood of Business Management, Global Business Review, 23, 1, pp. 119-136, (2022); Zhu, Ligeng, Deep leakage from gradients, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 32, (2019); Zhao, Qi, PrivateDL: Privacy-preserving collaborative deep learning against leakage from gradient sharing, International Journal of Intelligent Systems, 35, 8, pp. 1262-1279, (2020); Wang, Junxiao, Protect Privacy from Gradient Leakage Attack in Federated Learning, Proceedings - IEEE INFOCOM, 2022-May, pp. 580-589, (2022)","G.L.

Few previous studies, performed only during spinal surgery, analyzed and compared them during intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring. The aim of our study was to compare these two stimulation techniques for eliciting motor-evoked potentials during intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring in a group of patients affected by supratentorial lesions.Methods:Supratentorial lesions from 16 patients were retrospectively collected and analyzed. Motor-evoked potentials were performed only from transcranial electrical stimulation because the inability to place the subdural strip electrodes correctly did not permit to perform direct cortical stimulation. At the beginning of surgery, in each patient, motor-evoked potentials were monitored by using both ""fast-charge"" constant-voltage and ""slow-charge"" constant-current stimulation. Several neurophysiological parameters were collected and compared between the two stimulation techniques by means of statistical analysis.Results:""Fast-charge"" constant-voltage stimulation allowed statistically higher efficiency rates for eliciting motor-evoked potentials compared with ""slow-charge"" constant-current stimulation, both for upper and lower limbs. We also found that threshold and maximal charge as well as charge density were significantly lower during constant-voltage stimulation, thus lowering the potential tissue damage.Conclusions:""Fast-charge"" constant-voltage transcranial electrical stimulation is feasible and safe during intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring for supratentorial surgery and may be preferable to ""slow-charge"" constant-current stimulation. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

The continuum electrostatic model based on the Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation has been widely used to study biomolecular electrostatics. The solution of the PB equation gives the electrostatic potential over the space enclosing the molecule(s) of interest, typically obtained at points of a suitable grid. The Generalized Born (GB) model has been used to provide a useful approximation to the solution obtained by solving numerically the PB equation. The main advantage of the GB approach is to express the electrostatic energy of the system as the sum of pairwise interactions. The latter depend on geometric parameters (the GB radii) which depend on all atoms, and their radii, of the system. In this work we present a tutorial through examples for a more efficient and general version of the program Bluues which is able to compute: 1) the generalized Born radius of each atom; 2) the electrostatic potential at the surface of the molecule mapped to solvent accessible atoms; 3) the solvent accessible surface in a PDB formatted file; 4) the electrostatic potential in the volume surrounding the molecule; 5) the electrostatic free energy and different contributions to it; 6) the pH-dependent properties of proteins (total charge and pH-dependent free energy of folding) in the pH range −4 to 18; 7) the pKa shifts due to molecular structure of all ionizable groups.

As the previous one, this 64 channels integrated detection system includes ultra-low-noise front-end electronics, dedicated acquisition system, digital filtering, temperature control and stabilization. With respect to the SESAME version, the new instrument implements a tungsten collimation system yielding a total collimated sensitive area of 500 mm2. Optimized to work in an energy range of 3–30 keV, the system shows an overall energy resolution (sum of its 64 cells) below 180 eV FWHM at the 5.9 Mn Kα line at room temperature.

Efforts are increasing to introduce quantum physics in high school throughout Europe. These efforts must be underpinned by stringent teacher education, as well as by general education and for orientation to vocational fields. Research shows that many teachers need special support because of the peculiarities of quantum physics and the inherent problems in teaching. In particular, finding suitable teaching resources—be it real or remote and virtual experiments, simulations, exploration environments, digital media or any other media—is central for teachers. These tools are important for education as well as for teacher education in this area. The WG3 during the online seminar in Malta 2021, therefore, discussed this aspect of teacher education as well as the general shaping of teacher education in this field. The results of discussion and a final position are summarized in this paper that gives guidelines for teacher education programs on quantum physics. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","","","","","","","","We thank the following colleagues for contributing and participating to the discussion of the WG3 in Malta online seminar 2021 (in alphabetical order): Maria Bondani, Maria Luisa Chiofalo, James Feericks, Nilüfer Didiş Körhasan, Russell Mizzi, Filippo Pallotta, Henk Pol, Kirsten Stadermann, Stamatis Vokos.","Training Pre Service and in Service Secondary School Teachers Analysis of Changes in Perceptions about Quantum Physics Concepts and Nos Views, (2017); Baas, Marjon, Teachers’ adoption of open educational resources in higher education, Journal of Interactive Media in Education, 2019, 1, (2019); Bitzenbauer, Philipp, Practitioners' views on new teaching material for introducing quantum optics in secondary schools, Physics Education, 56, 5, (2021); J Phys Conf Ser, (2021); Buongiorno, Daniele, Discipline-Based Educational Research to Improve Active Learning at University, Contributions from Science Education Research, 9, pp. 305-316, (2021); Chiofalo, M.

We analyzed the correlation between such a signal and other standard signals usually present on board such as boat speed, intensity and direction of apparent or real wind; moreover, data from Inertial Measurement Units are handled. We also considered the Target Data, which depend on the actual point of sail, and the discrepancy between measured data and the predicted Targets is monitored as an error in terms of the true wind angle and boat velocity. In this way, the trimmer/helmsman can monitor the differential sail pressure together with Target data and decide to reduce the error with a correction in how sails are trimmed, rather than in how the boat is steered to achieve an improvement of boat performances. The resulting telemetry system represents an effective low cost solution, which is affordable even for amateur yachtsmen. © 2023 International Measurement Confederation (IMEKO).

At the same time, the belief models used in combination may have some limitations and may result in different reliabilities, which may decrease the performance of the combination. One way to confront this problem is to consider a discount rule utilizing reliability coefficients. One of the problems of using discounting is the way of modeling reliability coefficients. This paper proposes modeling reliability coefficients by considering a new effective measure of belief uncertainty. The new reliability coefficients are introduced in a multilayer decision fusion-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture built within the Transferable Belief Model, as well as in a multimodal deep learning scenario. Case study results demonstrate the feasibility of representing reliability by the belief uncertainty measure considered. © 2023 International Society of Information Fusion.","Classifier Fusion; Decision fusion; Deep Learning; Dempster-Shafer Theory; Reliability; Transferable Belief Theory","Convolutional neural networks; Decision theory; Deep learning; Multilayer neural networks; Reliability theory; Belief theory; Classifiers fusion; Decisions fusion; Dempster-Shafer theory; Evidential fusions; Fusion model; Model reliability; Optimistics; Transferable belief theory; Uncertainty analysis","","","","","","","Proceedings of the First Conference on Multisource Multisensor Information Fusion, (1998); Klein, Lawrence A., Sensor and data fusion: A tool for information assessment and decision making: Second edition, pp. 1-474, (2012); A Mathematical Theory of Evidence, (1976); Smets, Philippe, Data fusion in the transferable belief model, 1, pp. PS21-PS33, (2000); Rogova, Galina L., Reliability in information fusion: Literature survey, 2, pp. 1158-1165, (2004); Haenni, Rolf, Shedding new light on Zadeh's criticism of Dempster's rule of combination, 2, pp. 879-884, (2005); Nimier, Vincent, Supervised multisensor tracking algorithm, European Signal Processing Conference, 1998-January, (1998); Huang, Ling, Evidence Fusion with Contextual Discounting for Multi-modality Medical Image Segmentation, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 13435 LNCS, pp. 401-411, (2022); Information Quality in Information Fusion and Decision Making, (2019); Proc of the Forth Conf on Information Fusion, (2001)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","et al.; Lockheed Martin; Mathworks; Metron; Mitsubishi Electric; STR","26th International Conference on Information Fusion, FUSION 2023","2023-06-27 through 2023-06-30","Charleston","192045","","9798890344854","","","English","Int.

Applicability of this family is allowed, provided that the Jacobian matrix of the nonlinear system has a spectral radius less than one. By varying the order of a matrix geometric sum that approximates the inverse Jacobian matrix, root-finding at any iteration can be steered toward the FP or conversely toward the NR method, becoming identical to either of them if the order is equal to zero or infinitely large, respectively. Since the methods in this family do not need the solution of a linear system at each iteration as required by NR, their computational cost makes them palatable for the online digital implementation of nonlinear models. As an example of application, a Virtual Analog model of the voltage-controlled filter onboard a popular music synthesizer is tested, showing that for some orders of the aforementioned geometric sum the proposed methods perform better than FP and NR in terms of computational cost, while exhibiting the same accuracy. © 2023 IEEE.","delay-free loop; Fixed point (FP) methods; newton methods; virtual analog (VA); voltage controlled filter (VCF)","Bandpass filters; Computational efficiency; Costs; Digital control systems; Digital filters; Discrete time control systems; Inverse problems; Linear systems; Newton-Raphson method; Nonlinear equations; Nonlinear systems; Analog models; Computational modelling; Convergence; Delay free loops; Fixed points; Fixed-points method; Newton's methods; Virtual analogs; Voltage controled filter; Voltage-controlled; Jacobian matrices","","","","","","","Välimäki, Vesa, Virtual Analog Effects, pp. 473-522, (2011); Proc 22nd Colloquium on Music Informatics, (2018); de Sanctis, Giovanni, Virtual analog modeling in the wave-digital domain, IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing, 18, 4, pp. 715-727, (2010); Holters, Martin, Automatic decomposition of non-linear equation systems in audio effect circuit simulation, Proceedings of the International Conference on Digital Audio Effects, DAFx, pp. 138-144, (2017); Yeh, David T., Automated physical modeling of nonlinear audio circuits for real-time audio effectspart I: Theoretical development, IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing, 18, 4, pp. 728-737, (2010); Falaize, Antoine, Passive guaranteed simulation of analog audio circuits: A port-hamiltonian approach, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 6, 10, (2016); Fontana, Federico, Explicit fixed-point computation of nonlinear delay-free loop filter networks, IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio Speech and Language Processing, 26, 10, pp. 1884-1896, (2018); Fontana, Federico, Newton-Raphson Solution of Nonlinear Delay-Free Loop Filter Networks, IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio Speech and Language Processing, 27, 10, pp. 1590-1600, (2019); Fettweis, Alfred, Wave Digital Filters: Theory and Practice, Proceedings of the IEEE, 74, 2, pp. 270-327, (1986); Bernardini, Alberto, Linear Multistep Discretization Methods with Variable Step-Size in Nonlinear Wave Digital Structures for Virtual Analog Modeling, IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio Speech and Language Processing, 27, 11, pp. 1763-1776, (2019)","F.

Most works do this using classical Machine Learning tools that act on the acquired measurement data. This paper introduces two main elements: a low-cost platform to acquire, pre-process, and transmit data to classify contaminants in wastewater; and a novel classification approach to classify contaminants in wastewater, based on deep learning and the transformation of raw sensor data into natural language metadata. The proposed solution presents clear advantages against state-of-the-art systems in terms of higher effectiveness and reasonable efficiency. The main disadvantage of the proposed approach is that it relies on knowing the injection time, i.e., the instant in time when the contaminant is injected into the wastewater. For this reason, the developed system also includes a finite state machine tool able to infer the exact time instant when the substance is injected. The entire system is presented and discussed in detail. Furthermore, several variants of the proposed processing technique are also presented to assess the sensitivity to the number of used samples and the corresponding promptness/computational burden of the system. The lowest accuracy obtained by our technique is 91.4%, which is significantly higher than the 81.0% accuracy reached by the best baseline method. © 2013 IEEE.","causal models; language models; low-cost sensors; Water pollution","Classification (of information); Costs; Deep learning; Environmental technology; Learning algorithms; Metadata; Natural language processing systems; Pollution detection; Sewage; Water pollution; Causal modeling; Language model; Language processing; Low-cost sensors; Low-costs; Natural language generation; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Resistance; Wastewater pollution; Contamination","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (787128); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; European Commission, EC, (101113045); European Commission, EC","","Lee, Lester T., Long-Term Monitoring of Water and Air Quality at an Indoor Pool Facility during Modifications of Water Treatment, Water (Switzerland), 14, 3, (2022); Chojer, H., Development of low-cost indoor air quality monitoring devices: Recent advancements, Science of the Total Environment, 727, (2020); Farkas, Kata, Wastewater and public health: the potential of wastewater surveillance for monitoring COVID-19, Current Opinion in Environmental Science and Health, 17, pp. 14-20, (2020); Trubetskaya, Anna, A methodology for assessing and monitoring risk in the industrial wastewater sector, Water Resources and Industry, 25, (2021); Syrmos, Evangelos, An Intelligent Modular Water Monitoring IoT System for Real-Time Quantitative and Qualitative Measurements, Sustainability (Switzerland), 15, 3, (2023); Jalal, Dziri, Decision Tree and Support Vector Machine for Anomaly Detection in Water Distribution Networks, pp. 1320-1323, (2020); Eliades, Demetrios G., Water contamination impact evaluation and source-area isolation using decision trees, Journal of Water Resources Planning and Management - ASCE, 138, 5, pp. 562-570, (2012); Ria, Andrea, The SENSIPLUS: A Single-Chip Fully Programmable Sensor Interface, Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering, 866 LNEE, pp. 256-261, (2022); Molinara, Mario, A new Dataset for Detection of Illegal or Suspicious Spilling in Wastewater through Low-cost Real-time Sensors, pp. 293-298, (2022); Ferdinandi, Marco, A novel smart system for contaminants detection and recognition in water, pp. 186-191, (2019)","K.

Aim of this study was to evaluate possible risk factors for the occurrence of IOS.Methods:The authors performed a retrospective analysis of 155 patients affected by low-grade gliomas and tumor-related epilepsy, who underwent surgery in our Department, between 2007 and 2018. A statistical analysis was performed by means of univariate and multivariate regression to evaluate any possible correlation between seizure occurrence and several demographic, clinical, neurophysiological, and histopathological features.Results:Intraoperative seizure occurred in 39 patients (25.16%) with a total of 62 seizure events recorded. Focal seizures were the prevalent seizure type: among them, 39 seizures did not show motor signs, being those with only electrographic and/or with cognitive features the most represented subtypes. Twenty-six seizures occurring during surgery were not spontaneous: direct cortical stimulation with Penfield paradigm was the most prevalent evoking factor. The univariate analysis showed that the following prognostic factors were statistically associated with the occurrence of intraoperative seizure: the awake technique (P = 0.01) and the interictal epileptiform discharges detected on the baseline electrocorticography (ECoG) (P < 0.001). After controlling for confounding factors with multivariate analysis, the awake surgery and the epileptic ECoG pattern kept statistical significance.Conclusions:The awake surgery procedure and the epileptic ECoG pattern are risk factors for intraoperative seizure. ECoG is mandatory to detect electrographic seizures or seizures without motor signs. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

In this paper, we present an algorithm for computing embeddings for directed bigraphs, an extension of Milner's bigraphs which take into account the request directions between controls and names. This algorithm solves the embedding problem by means of a reduction to a constraint satisfaction problem. We first prove soundness and completeness of this algorithm; then we present an implementation in jLibBig, a general Java library for manipulating bigraphical reactive systems. The effectiveness of this implementation is shown by several experimental results. Finally, we show that this algorithm can be readily adapted to find the optimal embeddings in a weighted variant of the embedding problem. © 2022 The Author(s)","Bigraphs; Graph rewriting systems; Integer linear programming; Weighted bigraphs","Biological systems; Computation theory; Constraint satisfaction problems; Directed graphs; Information services; Integer programming; Multi agent systems; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Bigraphical reactive systems; Bigraphs; Directed bigraph; Embedding problems; Embeddings; Graph rewriting systems; Integer Linear Programming; Optimal embedding; Weighted bigraph","","","","","Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca, MIUR","Supported by Italian MIUR PRIN 2017FTXR7S IT MATTERS (Methods and Tools for Trustworthy Smart Systems).","Archibald, Blair, Practical bigraphs via subgraph isomorphism, Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics, LIPIcs, 210, (2021); Archibald, Blair, BigraphTalk: Verified Design of IoT Applications, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 7, 4, pp. 2955-2967, (2020); Bacci, Giorgio, Bigraphical models for protein and membrane interactions, Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science, EPTCS, 11, pp. 3-18, (2009); Bacci, Giorgio, DBtk: A toolkit for directed bigraphs, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 5728 LNCS, pp. 413-422, (2009); Bacci, Giorgio, Finding a forest in a tree: The matching problem for wide reactive systems, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 8902, pp. 17-33, (2014); Bundgaard, Mikkel, Formalizing higher-order mobile embedded business processes with binding bigraphs, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 5052 LNCS, pp. 83-99, (2008); Burco, Fabio, Towards a formal model for composable container systems, Proceedings of the ACM Symposium on Applied Computing, pp. 173-175, (2020); Thomas, Muffy A., Real-time verification of wireless home networks using bigraphs with sharing, Science of Computer Programming, 80, PART B, pp. 288-310, (2014); Thomas, Muffy A., Process algebra for event-driven runtime verification: A case study of wireless network management, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 7321 LNCS, pp. 21-23, (2012); Chiapperini, Alessio, Computing Embeddings of Directed Bigraphs, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 12150 LNCS, pp. 38-56, (2020)","M.

Gain and excess noise are computed efficiently using a non-local/history dependent model that has been validated against full-band Monte Carlo simulations. The (stochastic) response of the detector to photon pulses is computed using an improved Random-Path-Length algorithm. As case studies, we consider diodes consisting of AlGaAs/GaAs multi-layers with separated absorption and multiplication regions. A superlattice creating a staircase conduction band structure is employed in the multiplication region to keep the multiplication noise low.

Therefore, it is crucial to discover the biomarkers of disease outcome to improve clinical practice. In this study, 160 COVID-19 patients were enrolled, of whom 80 had a “non-severe” and 80 had a “severe” outcome. Sera were analyzed by proximity extension assay (PEA) to assess 274 unique proteins associated with inflammation, cardiometabolic, and neurologic diseases. The main clinical and hematochemical data associated with disease outcome were grouped with serological data to form a dataset for the supervised machine learning techniques. We identified nine proteins (i.e., CD200R1, MCP1, MCP3, IL6, LTBP2, MATN3, TRANCE, α2-MRAP, and KIT) that contributed to the correct classification of COVID-19 disease severity when combined with relative neutrophil and lymphocyte counts. By analyzing PEA, clinical and hematochemical data with statistical methods that were able to handle many variables in the presence of a relatively small sample size, we identified nine potential serum biomarkers of a “severe” outcome.

With a specific activity, we integrated a class of prospective kindergarten and primary school teachers on electric circuits with a reflection on the cognitive and linguistic aspects of metaphor. To understand how effective this integration proved to be, both in terms of learning and in terms of developing teaching skills, we conducted a single case study with a mixed qualitative–quantitative methodol-ogy. Student teachers were invited to analyze and discuss expressions on electric circuits selected from those they themselves had formulated at an earlier time.

In Presto, the automated optimization of a conditional rewrite theory R (whose rules define the concurrent transitions of a system) is achieved by partially evaluating, with respect to the rules of R, an underlying, companion equational logic theory E that specifies the algebraic structure of the system states of R. This can be particularly useful for specializing an overly general equational theory E whose operators may obey complex combinations of associativity, commutativity, and/or identity axioms, when being plugged into a host rewrite theory R as happens, for instance, in protocol analysis, where sophisticated equational theories for cryptography are used. Presto implements different unfolding operators that are based on folding variant narrowing (the symbolic engine of Maude’s equational theories). When combined with an appropriate abstraction algorithm, they allow the specialization to be adapted to the theory termination behavior and bring significant improvement while ensuring strong correctness and termination of the specialization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Presto in several examples of protocol analysis where it achieves a significant speed-up. Actually, the transformation provided by Presto may cut down an infinite folding variant narrowing space to a finite one, and moreover, some of the costly algebraic axioms and rule conditions may be eliminated as well. As far as we know, this is the first partial evaluator for Maude that respects the semantics of functional, logic, concurrent, and object-oriented computations. © The Author(s), 2022.","multi-paradigm declarative programming; narrowing; partial evaluation; rewriting logic","Algebra; Computer circuits; Object oriented programming; Declarative Programming; Equational theory; Logic theory; Multi-paradigm; Multi-paradigm declarative programming; Narrowing; Partial evaluation; Rewrite theory; Rewriting logic; Specialisation; Semantics","","","","","European Regional Development Fund, ERDF; Generalitat Valenciana, GVA, (PROMETEO/2019/098, APOSTD/2019/127); Horizon 2020, (RTI2018-094403-B-C32, MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (952215)","This research was partially supported by TAILOR, a project funded by EU Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under GA No 952215, grant RTI2018-094403-B-C32 funded by MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033 and by\u201DERDF A way of making Europe\u201D, and by Generalitat Valenciana under grant PROMETEO/2019/098.

Reconnaissance and surveillance against intrusions, search and rescue in hostile environments, speaker detection and localization are examples of real applications in which an accurate and efficient analysis of the acoustic scene is required. In this context, we have been investigating an efficient CNN neural network-based method capable of learning from the multi-channel signal an intrinsic function between a specific choice of audio-related features and both the nature of the acoustic event and its spatial location. In this work, we investigate an extended CNN network and compare its performance with the accuracy of a reduced complexity CNN network. The main novelty introduced in this research with respect to the state-of-the-art is that we propose a Diagonal Unloading (DU) Beamforming-based method that produces acoustic maps of azimuth and elevation angles to generate the feature representation of the acoustic signal. A comparative study with the Log-Mel Spectrogram feature representation is also conduced along with a method with fusion of the two feature representations that has been experimented in this work. The dataset for both training and validation of the CNN network belongs to the DCASE challenge. The experiments demonstrated the benefits introduced by the DU-Acoustic Map feature representation that provides additional information about the position of acoustic sources, in terms of angles of azimuth and elevation, through the acoustic maps. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed deep learning-based method are confirmed by the results. © 2022 IEEE.","CNN network; Detection of Acoustic Events; Diagonal Unloading Beamforming; DU-Acoustic Map and Log-Mel Spectrogram fusion; Localization of Acoustic Sources","Audio acoustics; Complex networks; Deep neural networks; Spectrographs; Unloading; Acoustic events; Acoustic logs; Acoustic maps; Acoustic sources; CNN network; Detection of acoustic event; Diagonal unloading beamforming; Diagonal unloading-acoustic map and log-mel spectrogram fusion; Localisation; Localization of acoustic source; Spectrograms; Beamforming","","","","","","","Task 3 Sound Event Localization and Detection, (2019); Salvati, Daniele, A Low-Complexity Robust Beamforming Using Diagonal Unloading for Acoustic Source Localization, IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio Speech and Language Processing, 26, 3, pp. 609-622, (2018); Submitted to Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events 2019 Workshop Dcase2019, (2019); IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing, (2018); Cobos, Máximo, A survey of sound source localization methods in wireless acoustic sensor networks, Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing, 2017, (2017); Toma, Andrea, CNN-based processing of acoustic and radio frequency signals for speaker localization from MAVs, Proceedings of the Annual Conference of the International Speech Communication Association, INTERSPEECH, 4, pp. 2803-2807, (2021); Yamazaki, Yuki, Audio-Processing-Based Human Detection at Disaster Sites with Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 101398-101405, (2020); Yaremenko, Vladimir, Unattended Acoustic Sensor Systems for Source Detection, Classification, and Tracking, IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement, 68, 2, pp. 344-354, (2019); Zhang, Bin, Sound Source Localization and Interaction based Human Searching Robot under Disaster Environment, pp. 16-20, (2019); Choi, Jeonghwan, Convolutional neural network-based direction-of-arrival estimation using stereo microphones for drone, (2020)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","et al; IEEE; IET; the Evolutionary Programming Society; the IEEE CIS; the International Neural Network Society (INNS); University of Padova","2022 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, IJCNN 2022","2022-07-18 through 2022-07-23","Padua","183333","21614393; 21614407","9781509060146; 9780738133669; 9781728119854; 9781665488679; 9781457710865; 9798350359312; 9781728169262; 9781728186719; 9781509061815; 9781509006199","85OFA","","English","Proc Int Jt Conf Neural Networks","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140771946"

This article describes a PE methodology for optimizing rewrite theories that encode concurrent as well as nondeterministic systems by means of the Maude language. The main advantages of the proposed methodology can be summarized as follows: • An automatic program optimization technique for rewrite theories featuring several PE criteria that support the specialization of a broad class of rewrite theories. • An incremental partial evaluation modality that allows the key specialization components to be encapsulated at the desired granularity level to facilitate progressive refinements of the specialization. • All executability theory requirements are preserved by the PE transformation. Also the transformation ensures the semantic equivalence between the original rewrite theory and the specialized theory under rather mild conditions. © 2022 The Author(s)","Algebraic specification; Code optimization; Concurrent and non-deterministic system modeling; Narrowing-based partial evaluation; Narrowing-based program specialization for rewrite theories; Rewriting logic, Maude; Symbolic reasoning","algorithm; Article; compression; controlled study; language; process optimization; specialization; speech; workflow","","","","","European Regional Development Fund, ERDF; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (952215); Generalitat Valenciana, GVA, (PROMETEO/2019/098); Horizon 2020, (PID2021-122830OB-C42, MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033)","This work was partially supported by TAILOR, a project funded by the EU Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under GA No 952215, grant PID2021-122830OB-C42 funded by MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033 and by \u201DERDF A way of making Europe\u201D, and by the Generalitat Valenciana under grant PROMETEO/2019/098.","Alpuente, María, Static correction of Maude programs with assertions, Journal of Systems and Software, 153, pp. 64-85, (2019); Alpuente, María, Optimization of rewrite theories by equational partial evaluation, Journal of Logical and Algebraic Methods in Programming, 124, (2022); Alpuente, María, Debugging Maude programs via runtime assertion checking and trace slicing, Journal of Logical and Algebraic Methods in Programming, 85, 5, pp. 707-736, (2016); Andrei, Oana, A rewriting logic framework for operational semantics of membrane systems, Theoretical Computer Science, 373, 3, pp. 163-181, (2007); All about Maude - A High-Performance Logical Framework How to Specify, Program and Verify Systems in Rewriting Logic, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 4350 LNCS, (2007); Escobar, Santiago, Folding variant narrowing and optimal variant termination, Journal of Logic and Algebraic Programming, 81, 7-8, pp. 898-928, (2012); Partial Evaluation and Automatic Program Generation, (1993); Marinescu, Mihnea, Partial-Evaluation Techniques for Concurrent Programs, SIGPLAN Notices (ACM Special Interest Group on Programming Languages), 32, 12, pp. 47-60, (1997); Meseguer, José, Conditional rewriting logic as a unified model of concurrency, Theoretical Computer Science, 96, 1, pp. 73-155, (1992); Meseguer, José, Variant-based satisfiability in initial algebras, Communications in Computer and Information Science, 596, pp. 3-34, (2016)","D.

The automatic retrieval and tracking of news has been addressed by a good number of works in the information retrieval literature.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is contributing significantly to the development of these systems, and the automotive industry is the most prominent example of ""smart"" technology entering the market: there are Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS), Radar/LIDAR detection units and camera-based Computer Vision systems that can assess driving conditions. Actually, these technologies have become consumer goods and services in mass-produced vehicles to provide human drivers with tools for a more comfortable and safer driving. Nevertheless, they need to be further improved for progress in the transition to fully automated driving or simply to increase vehicle automation levels. To this end, it becomes imperative to accurately predict driver’s decisions, model human driving behaviors, and introduce more accurate risk assessment metrics. This paper presents a system that can learn to predict the future braking behavior of a driver in a typically urban vehicle-pedestrian conflict, i.e., when a pedestrian enters a zebra crossing from the curb and a vehicle is approaching. The algorithm proposes a sequential prediction of relevant operational indicators that continuously describe the encounter process. A car driving simulator was used to collect reliable data on braking behaviours of a cohort of 68 licensed university students, who faced the same urban scenario. The vehicle speed, steering wheel angle, and pedal activity were recorded as the participants approached the crosswalk, along with the azimuth angle of the pedestrian and the relative longitudinal distance between the vehicle and the pedestrian: the proposed system employs the vehicle information as human driving decisions and the pedestrian information as explanatory variables of the environmental state. In fact, the pedestrian’s polar coordinates are usually calculated by an on-board millimeter-wave radar which is typically used to perceive the environment around a vehicle. All mentioned information is represented in the form of time series data and is used to train a recurrent neural network in a supervised machine learning process. The main purpose of this research is to define a system of behavioral profiles in non-collision conditions that could be used for enhancing the existing intelligent driving systems, e.g., to reduce the number of warnings when the driver is not on a collision course with a pedestrian. Preliminary experiments reveal the feasibility of the proposed system. © 2022 The Authors. Published by ELSEVIER B.V.

A novel approach for an objective and semi‐automatic identification of the optimal ANN’s structure, defined by the so‐called hyperparameters, has been introduced and discussed. Mechanical and volumetric data were obtained by conducting laboratory tests on 320 Marshall specimens, and the results were used to train the neural network. The k‐fold Cross Validation method has been used for partitioning the available data set, to obtain an unbiased evaluation of the model predictive error.

Other manifestations may be associated to CACNA1A mutations, such as migraine and epilepsy. The correlation between episodic ataxia and epilepsy is often underestimated and misdiagnosed. Clinical presentation of EA2 varies among patients and within the same family, and the same genetic mutation can lead to different clinical phenotypes. We herewith describe an Italian family presenting with typical EA2 and, in two of the family members (patients II.3 and III.1), epileptic seizures. The sequencing revealed a heterozygous deletion of 6 nucleotides in exon 28 of CACNA1A gene, present in all affected patients. Evidence suggests that mutations of CACNA1A, conferring a loss/reduction of CaV2.1 function, lead to an increase of thalamocortical excitation that contributes to epileptiform discharges. Our description highlights intra-family variability of EA2 phenotype and suggests that mutations in the CACNA1A gene should be suspected in individuals with focal or generalized epilepsy, associated with a family history of episodic ataxia. © 2021, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","CACNA1A; Cerebellar atrophy; Channelopathy; Epilepsy; Hereditary ataxia","acetazolamide; alprazolam; ethosuximide; levetiracetam; unclassified drug; valproic acid; voltage gated calcium channel; voltage gated PQ type calcium channel subunit alpha 1A; vortioxetine; absence; adult; anticonvulsant therapy; Article; ataxic gait; benign childhood epilepsy; case report; cerebellum atrophy; clinical article; depression; distal paresthesia; dizziness; drug withdrawal; dysarthria; dysmetria; electroencephalography; epilepsy; epileptic discharge; episodic ataxia type 2; exon; family history; family study; female; focal epilepsy; follow up; gene deletion; gene mutation; generalized epilepsy; genetic screening; hand paresthesia; hereditary ataxia; heterozygosity; human; hyperventilation; Italian (citizen); male; middle aged; molecular pathology; nerve stimulation; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nystagmus; panic; phenotype; protein function; suicidal ideation; thalamocortical tract; unsteadiness; vertigo; young adult; ataxia; cerebellar ataxia; genetics; Ataxia; Cerebellar Ataxia; Epilepsy; Humans; Nystagmus, Pathologic","","acetazolamide, 1424-27-7, 59-66-5; alprazolam, 28981-97-7, 135748-32-2; ethosuximide, 77-67-8; levetiracetam, 102767-28-2; valproic acid, 1069-66-5, 99-66-1; vortioxetine, 508233-74-7, 960203-27-4","QIAsynphony SP, Quiagen","Quiagen","UK Research and Innovation, UKRI, (103530)","","Jen, Joanna C., Clinical spectrum of episodic ataxia type 2, Neurology, 62, 1, pp. 17-22, (2004); Catterall, William A., Structure and regulation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology, 16, pp. 521-555, (2000); Mantuano, Elide, Identification of novel and recurrent CACNA1A gene mutations in fifteen patients with episodic ataxia type 2, Journal of the Neurological Sciences, 291, 1-2, pp. 30-36, (2010); Ilg, Winfried, Consensus paper: Management of degenerative cerebellar disorders, Cerebellum, 13, 2, pp. 248-268, (2014); Strupp, Michael Leo, A randomized trial of 4-aminopyridine in EA2 and related familial episodic ataxias, Neurology, 77, 3, pp. 269-275, (2011); Guterman, Elan L., Pearls and Oy-sters: Episodic ataxia type 2: Case report and review of the literature, Neurology, 86, 23, pp. e239-e241, (2016); den Dunnen, Johan T., HGVS Recommendations for the Description of Sequence Variants: 2016 Update, Human Mutation, 37, 6, pp. 564-569, (2016); Baloh, Robert W., Familial episodic ataxia: Clinical heterogeneity in four families linked to chromosome 19p, Annals of Neurology, 41, 1, pp. 8-16, (1997); Rajakulendran, Sanjeev, Genetic and functional characterisation of the P/Q calcium channel in episodic ataxia with epilepsy, Journal of Physiology, 588, 11, pp. 1905-1913, (2010); Imbrici, Paola, Dysfunction of the brain calcium channel Cav2.1 in absence epilepsy and episodic ataxia, Brain, 127, 12, pp. 2682-2692, (2004)","L.

In recent years, methods that estimate entropy using k-th nearest neighbours (kNN) have been applied to internal degrees of freedom in biomolecular simulations, and for the rigorous computation of positional-orientational entropy of one and two molecules. The mutual information expansion (MIE) and the maximum information spanning tree (MIST) methods were proposed and used to deal with a large number of non-independent degrees of freedom, providing estimates or bounds on the global entropy, thus complementing the kNN method. The application of the combination of such methods to solvent molecules appears problematic because of the indistinguishability of molecules and of their symmetric parts. All indistiguishable molecules span the same global conformational volume, making application of MIE and MIST methods difficult. Here, we address the problem of indistinguishability by relabeling water molecules in such a way that each water molecule spans only a local region throughout the simulation. Then, we work out approximations and show how to compute the single-molecule entropy for the system of relabeled molecules. The results suggest that relabeling water molecules is promising for computation of solvation entropy. © 2021 by the authors.","assignment problem; entropy; hungarian algorithm; relabeling; solvation","","","","","","Università degli Studi di Udine, Uniud, (PRID2017)","This research was funded by the University of Udine grant PRID2017 (Project PRONANO).","Gilson, Michael K., The statistical-thermodynamic basis for computation of binding affinities: A critical review, Biophysical Journal, 72, 3, pp. 1047-1069, (1997); Roux, Benoı̂t Thomas, Implicit solvent models, Biophysical Chemistry, 78, 1-2, pp. 1-20, (1999); Kollman, Peter A., Calculating structures and free energies of complex molecules: Combining molecular mechanics and continuum models, Accounts of Chemical Research, 33, 12, pp. 889-897, (2000); Wereszczynski, Jeff M., Statistical mechanics and molecular dynamics in evaluating thermodynamic properties of biomolecular recognition, Quarterly Reviews of Biophysics, 45, 1, pp. 1-25, (2012); Polyansky, Anton A., Estimation of conformational entropy in protein-ligand interactions: A computational perspective, Methods in Molecular Biology, 819, pp. 327-353, (2012); Suárez, Dimas, Direct methods for computing single-molecule entropies from molecular simulations, Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Computational Molecular Science, 5, 1, pp. 1-26, (2015); Kassem, Summer M., Entropy in bimolecular simulations: A comprehensive review of atomic fluctuations-based methods, Journal of Molecular Graphics and Modelling, 62, pp. 105-117, (2015); Fogolari, Federico, Free energy, enthalpy and entropy from implicit solvent end-point simulations, Frontiers in Molecular Biosciences, 5, FEB, (2018); Beveridge, David L., Free energy via molecular simulation: applications to chemical and biomolecular systems., Annual Review of Biophysics and Biophysical Chemistry, 18, pp. 431-492, (1989); Zwanzig, Robert W., High†ï¿½Temperature Equation of State by a Perturbation Method.

This paper presents a Gated Recurrent Unitbased system that aims to predict, up to 3 s ahead in time, the severity level of V2P encounters, depending on the current scene representation drawn from on-board radars’ data. A car-driving simulator experiment has been designed to collect sequential mobility features on a cohort of 65 licensed university students who faced different V2P conflicts on a planned urban route. To accurately describe the pedestrian safety condition during the encounter process, a combination of surrogate safety indicators, namely TAdv (Time Advantage) and T2 (Nearness of the Encroachment), are considered for modeling. Due to the nature of these indicators, multiple recurrent neural networks are trained to separately predict T2 continuous values and TAdv categories. Afterwards, their predictions are exploited to label serious conflict interactions. As a comparison, an additional Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural network is developed to directly predict the severity level of innercity encounters. The latter neural model reaches the best performance on the test set, scoring a recall value of 0.899. Based on selected threshold values, the presented models can be used to label pedestrians near accident events and to enhance existing intelligent driving systems. © 2021 by the authors.

Here we describe a 2-year-old female child harboring a novel de novo missense variant in HDAC8, whose phenotypical score, according to the recent consensus on CdLS clinical diagnostic criteria, allowed the diagnosis of a non-classic CdLS. Methods: Clinical exome sequencing was performed on the trio, identifying a de novo heterozygous variant in HDAC8 (NM_018486; c. 356C>G p.Thr119Arg). Molecular modeling was performed to evaluate putative functional consequence of the HDAC8 protein. Results: The variant HDAC8 c.356C>G is classified as pathogenic following the ACMG (American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics)/AMP (Association for Molecular Pathology) guidelines. By molecular modeling, we confirmed the deleterious effect of this variant, since the amino acid change compromises the conformational flexibility of the HDAC8 loop required for optimal catalytic function. Conclusion: We described a novel Thr119Arg mutation in HDAC8 in a patient displaying the major phenotypic traits of the CdLS. Our results suggest that a modest change outside an active site is capable of triggering global structural changes that propagate through the protein scaffold to the catalytic site, creating de facto haploinsufficiency. © 2021 The Authors.

SIRPIDs are frequently seen in patients who are critically ill from various causes. The literature reflects the findings of triphasic morphology, with the generalized periodic discharge (GPD) classification in many patients with SIRPIDs: toxic/metabolic encephalopathies, septic, and hypoxemic/hypercapnic encephalopathies, but also sharp periodic complexes in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and advanced Alzheimer's disease. In these settings, GPDs disappear when patients fall asleep and reappear when patients spontaneously wake up, or are awoken by an external stimulus, or sometimes because of a respiratory event, with the possibility of the appearance of GPDs with a cyclic alternating pattern. SIRPIDs may be seen as a transitional pattern between sleep and waking states, corresponding to a postarousal/awakening phenomenon. As SIRPIDs are a transient phenomenon and can usually be recorded repeatedly with each stimulation, the word “Ictal” could be replaced by “Intermittent”: Stimulus-Induced Rhythmic or Periodic Intermittent Discharges. However, considering that SIRPIDs may be “potentially ictal” or on an “ictal–interictal continuum“ in some situations, the “plus” modifier may be added: SIRPIDs-plus. © 2021 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology","Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease; Cyclic alternating pattern; SIRPIDs; Sleep-to-wake transition; Sleep-wake cycle; Triphasic Waves","anesthetic agent; Alzheimer disease; anesthesia; brain disease; brain toxicity; clinical assessment; Creutzfeldt Jakob disease; critically ill patient; electroencephalogram; epileptic discharge; human; metabolic encephalopathy; nonREM sleep; Review; sleep pattern; sleep waking cycle; stimulus induced rhythmic or periodic intermittent discharge; wakefulness; brain; diagnostic imaging; electroencephalography; pathophysiology; periodicity; physiology; procedures; sleep stage; Brain; Brain Waves; Creutzfeldt-Jakob Syndrome; Electroencephalography; Humans; Periodicity; Sleep Stages; Wakefulness","","","","","American Clinical Neurophysiology Society, ACNS","Dr. Kaplan has been on the board of the American Board of Clinical Neurophysiology, the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society, consulted for Ceribell and lectured on EEG.","Alpert, Jack Nathaniel, The neurologic diagnosis: A practical bedside approach, pp. 1-297, (2012); Baldy-Moulinier, Michel, 24 hour polygraphic study of the waking-up and falling asleep periods in patients with hepatic encephalopathy, Revue d'Electroencephalographie et de Neurophysiologie Clinique, 11, 1, pp. 123-132, (1981); Electroencephalography Basic Principles Clinical Applications and Related Fields Fifth Ed, (2005); Bauer, Gerhard, EEG patterns in hypoxic encephalopathies (post-cardiac arrest syndrome): Fluctuations, transitions, and reactions, Journal of Clinical Neurophysiology, 30, 5, pp. 477-489, (2013); Beach, Robert L., The EEG in inflammatory CNS conditions, pp. 331-350, (2012); Aasm Manual for the Scoring of Sleep and Associated Events Rules Terminology and Technical Specifications, (2007); Bhatt, Amar B., De novo generalized periodic discharges related to anesthetic withdrawal resolve spontaneously, Journal of Clinical Neurophysiology, 31, 3, pp. 194-198, (2014); Bongiovanni, Filippo, Standardized EEG analysis to reduce the uncertainty of outcome prognostication after cardiac arrest, Intensive Care Medicine, 46, 5, pp. 963-972, (2020); Bortone, Ermelinda, Reliability of EEG in the diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology, 90, 5, pp. 323-330, (1994); Boulanger, Jean Martin, Triphasic waves versus nonconvulsive status epilepticus: EEG distinction, Canadian Journal of Neurological Sciences, 33, 2, pp. 175-180, (2006)","P.

This has further pushed the idea of blazar jets being among those cosmic sites where significant neutrino production may take place. We use a procedure based on source-internal electromagnetic cascading to constrain the environments of neutrino-producing sites in photomeson production models of jetted AGN. The role of external photon fields as the dominant target for particle-photon interactions including possible effects of the anisotropic nature of the interactions in the co-moving jet frame is discussed. We apply this procedure to the 2014-15 neutrino spectrum observed by IceCube from TXS 0506+056 to conduct a comprehensive study of these cascade spectra. By comparing these to the simultaneous multi-wavelength emission of this blazar constraints on the environment of the neutrino-emitting region are derived. © Copyright owned by the author(s) under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)","","Cosmic rays; Cosmology; Neutrons; Photons; Cosmics; Electromagnetics; Gamma-rays; Ice cubes; Multi-wavelength emissions; Neutrino spectrum; Photon fields; Photon interactions; Production models; Spectra's; Gamma rays","","","","","(DE-AC02-76SF00515); (64789); U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA; Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, डीएसटी; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, MEXT; Austrian Science Fund, FWF, (I 3452-N27); Austrian Science Fund, FWF; Centre National d’Etudes Spatiales, CNES; Agenzia Spaziale Italiana, ASI; Instituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare, INFN; Vetenskapsrådet, VR; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, CNRS; Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica, INAF; High Energy Accelerator Research Organization, KEK; Institut National de Physique Nucléaire et de Physique des Particules, IN2P3; National Tea Research Foundation, NTRF","Funding text 1: A.R. acknowledges financial support from the Austrian Science Fund (FWF), project I 3452-N27.

The kth nearest neighbor method, which offers a convenient way to estimate the entropy in high-dimensional spaces, has been previously applied for translational-rotational entropy estimation. Here, we explore the possibility of extending the kth nearest neighbor method to the computation of the entropy of correlated translation-rotations of two molecules, i.e., in the product space of two translation-rotations, both referred to the same independent reference system, which is relevant for all cases in which the correlated translational-rotational motion of more than two molecules is involved. Numerical tests show that, albeit the relatively high dimensionality (12) of the space, the kth nearest neighbor approach provides an accurate estimate for the entropy of two correlated translational-rotational motions, even when computed from a limited number of samples. ©","","article; entropy; rotation","","","","","","This work was partly supported by a MISTI-MIT-FVG (2018) grant.","Gilson, Michael K., The statistical-thermodynamic basis for computation of binding affinities: A critical review, Biophysical Journal, 72, 3, pp. 1047-1069, (1997); Zhou, Huanx Xiang, Theory of free energy and entropy in noncovalent binding, Chemical Reviews, 109, 9, pp. 4092-4107, (2009); Finkelstein, A.

Spastic paraplegia type 4 (SPG4) is the most common autosomal dominant form of HSP and is caused by mutations in the SPAST gene. SPAST gene encodes for the protein spastin, a member of the ATPases Associated with a variety of cellular Activity (AAA) family. We describe a newly variant in SPAST gene, within an Italian family affected by pure HSP. In particular, we found a heterozygous intragenic micro-deletion of 3T in exon 13 of SPG4 gene. The 3T deletion results in a mutated protein with a unique leucine residues deletion at the protein position 508, in the AAA ATPase domain. This variant is not registered in any public database either as rare normal variant nor as mutation in SPAST gene and the importance of this ami-noacid is confirmed by the absolute conservation in multiple alignments with diverse species. We conclude that the novel SPAST gene variant identified is probably pathogenic and destabilizes the precise arrangement of the nucleotide binding domain, with a consequent loss-of-function of the mutated spastin protein.

Method: Retrospective analysis from two French tertiary centers. Results: Forty patients were enrolled (31 females and 9 males; sex ratio F/M = 3.44; mean age at epilepsy onset: 6.2 ± 3.4 years [range: 1–15 years]). A positive family history of generalized genetic epilepsy was reported by 13 patients (32.5 %). Eyelid myoclonias with or without absence were the seizure onset in 29 patients (72.5 %), and generalized tonic-clonic seizures in 11 (27.5 %). Over the course of the disease, all had absences. Intellectual disability and psychiatric disorders were reported in 14 (35 %) and 18 patients (45 %), respectively. Focal EEG abnormalities were observed in 65 % of patients, with a posterior (57.7 %) or anterior (30 %) distribution. Generalized EEG discharges were identified in 37 patients (92.5 %). Epileptiform abnormalities were activated during NREM sleep and increased upon awakening. Response to intermittent light stimulation (ILS) was observed in 34 patients (85 %), with an unusual pattern of epileptiform abnormalities at the same frequency of the flashes in 20 patients. Patients with all seizure types were more likely to have this response (p = 0.017). Conclusion: JS is a lifelong genetic epileptic syndrome with onset in childhood, female preponderance, and a positive family history of epilepsy in one-third of the cases. Focal EEG abnormalities are frequent. Response to ILS appears different from other photosensitive syndromes, with an unusual pattern of photo-induced abnormal synchronization. Intellectual disability and psychiatric disorders are not rare. © 2021 British Epilepsy Association","Focal EEG abnormalities; Generalized genetic epilepsy; Jeavons syndrome; Photoparoxysmal response; Photosensitivity","anticonvulsive agent; levetiracetam; valproic acid; adolescent; adult; Article; child; clinical article; clinical feature; controlled study; electroencephalography; electroencephalography phase synchronization; epilepsy; eyelid closure; eyelid disease; female; gene expression profiling; human; intellectual impairment; Jeavons syndrome; male; mental disease; mental stress; morphology; myoclonus; nonREM sleep; observational study; photosensitivity; retrospective study; sex difference; stroboscopy; Wechsler adult intelligence scale; eyelid; generalized epilepsy; infant; preschool child; seizure; Adolescent; Child; Child, Preschool; Electroencephalography; Epilepsy, Generalized; Eyelids; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Myoclonus; Retrospective Studies; Seizures","","levetiracetam, 102767-28-2; valproic acid, 1069-66-5, 99-66-1","","","","","Jeavons, Peter M., Nosological Problems of Myoclonic Epilepsies in Childhood and Adolescence, Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology, 19, 1, pp. 3-8, (1977); Koutroumanidis, Michael A., The role of EEG in the diagnosis and classification of the epilepsy syndromes: a tool for clinical practice by the ILAE Neurophysiology Task Force (Part 1), Epileptic Disorders, 19, 3, pp. 233-298, (2017); Striano, Salvatore, Eyelid myoclonia with absences (Jeavons syndrome): A well-defined idiopathic generalized epilepsy syndrome or a spectrum of photosensitive conditions?, Epilepsia, 50, SUPPL. 5, pp. 15-19, (2009); Destına Yalçin, Ayşe, Overlap cases of eyelid myoclonia with absences and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, Seizure, 15, 6, pp. 359-365, (2006); Caraballo, Roberto Horacio, A study of 63 cases with eyelid myoclonia with or without absences: Type of seizure or an epileptic syndrome?, Seizure, 18, 6, pp. 440-445, (2009); J Epileptol, (2015); Smith, Kelsey M., Jeavons Syndrome: Clinical Features and Response to Treatment, Pediatric Neurology, 86, pp. 46-51, (2018); Epilepsies Seizures Syndromes and Management, (2005); Striano, Salvatore, Eyelid myoclonia with absences: An overlooked epileptic syndrome?, Neurophysiologie Clinique, 32, 5, pp. 287-296, (2002); Capovilla, Giuseppe, Eyelid fluttering, typical EEG pattern, and impaired intellectual function: A homogeneous epileptic condition among the patients presenting with eyelid myoclonia, Epilepsia, 50, 6, pp. 1536-1541, (2009)","P.

The drug causes lymphocyte count reduction, which can lead to lymphopenia development during treatment. This is an important safety issue, due to infectious risk, mainly progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). If the lymphocyte count influences the response to treatment is still a matter of debate, as there are contrasting contrasting data in the literature. Considering this, we aimed to identify DMF induced lymphopenia risk factors and to evaluate lymphopenia impact on MS disease activity in a real world setting. Methods: a retrospective study on 135 MS patients receiving DMF with a mean treatment duration of 32.3±15.9 months was performed. Baseline and follow-up demographic, clinical, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and laboratory data were collected. Results: 44 patients (32.6%) developed lymphopenia, with 11 (8.1%) grade 1, 23 (17.0%) grade 2 and 10 (7.4 %) grade 3. Older age and lower basal absolute lymphocyte count were found to be associated with lymphopenia development on a binary regression model (p<0.001 and p=0.009). When compared with non lymphopenic+lymphopenia grade 1 patients, those experiencing lymphopenia grade 2+3 had longer disease activity free survival (p<0.001), fewer clinical relapses (p=0.005) and lower MRI disease activity (p≤0.001). On Cox regression model, older age and lymphopenia grade 2+3 were found to be protective factors against disease activity (HR=0.966; 95% C.I.=0.942-0.992; p=0.009 for age; HR=0.137; 95% C.I.=0.043-0.439; p=0.001 for lymphopenia grade 2+3) and MRI disease activity (HR=0.968; 95% C.I.=0.941-0.997; p=0.030 for age; HR=0.142; 95% C.I.=0.034-0.591; p=0.007 for lymphopenia grade 2+3). Only lymphopenia grade 2+3 was found to be a predictor of clinical relapses (HR=0.970; 95% C.I.=0.936-1.005; p=0.095 for age; HR=0.115; 95% C.I.=0.016-0.854; p=0.034 for lymphopenia grade 2+3), with a protective effect. Conclusion: older age and lower basal lymphocyte count were found to be associated with lymphopenia development. Lymphopenia grade 2+3 and older age could be protective against clinical and radiologic disease activity during DMF treatment. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Dimethyl fumarate; Lymphocyte count; Lymphopenia; Multiple sclerosis; Risk factors; Treatment response","dimethyl fumarate; immunosuppressive agent; adult; age distribution; Article; demography; disease activity; disease free survival; female; follow up; human; human cell; lymphocyte count; lymphocytopenia; major clinical study; male; multiple sclerosis; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; observational study; recurrence risk; retrospective study; risk assessment; risk factor; treatment duration; aged; tumor recurrence; Aged; Dimethyl Fumarate; Humans; Immunosuppressive Agents; Lymphocyte Count; Multiple Sclerosis; Multiple Sclerosis, Relapsing-Remitting; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Retrospective Studies","","dimethyl fumarate, 624-49-7; Dimethyl Fumarate; Immunosuppressive Agents","","","","","Mills, Elizabeth A., Emerging understanding of the mechanism of action for dimethyl fumarate in the treatment of multiple sclerosis, Frontiers in Neurology, 9, JAN, (2018); Spencer, Collin M., Reduction of CD8+ T lymphocytes in multiple sclerosis patients treated with dimethyl fumarate, Neurology: Neuroimmunology and NeuroInflammation, 2, 3, (2015); Mehta, Devangi S., Effect of dimethyl fumarate on lymphocytes in RRMS: Implications for clinical practice, Neurology, 92, 15, pp. e1724-e1738, (2019); Fox, Robert J., Characterizing absolute lymphocyte count profiles in dimethyl fumarate'treated patients with MS Patient management considerations, Neurology: Clinical Practice, 6, 3, pp. 220-229, (2016); Sainz-De-La-Maza, Susana, Factors associated with dimethyl fumarate-induced lymphopenia, Journal of the Neurological Sciences, 398, pp. 4-8, (2019); Goldman, Myla D., Patient-specific factors modulate leukocyte response in dimethyl fumarate treated MS patients, PLOS ONE, 15, 2, (2020); Fleischer, Vinzenz, Treatment response to dimethyl fumarate is characterized by disproportionate CD8+ T cell reduction in MS, Multiple Sclerosis Journal, 24, 5, pp. 632-641, (2018); Sierra-Morales, Fabian, Risk factors for lymphopenia in patients with relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis treated with dimethyl fumarate, Journal of Neurology, 267, 1, pp. 125-131, (2020); Boffa, G., Fingolimod and Dimethyl-Fumarate-Derived Lymphopenia is not Associated with Short-Term Treatment Response and Risk of Infections in a Real-Life MS Population, CNS Drugs, (2020); Lanzillo, Roberta, Clinical predictors of Dimethyl Fumarate response in multiple sclerosis: a real life multicentre study, Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders, 38, (2020)","R.

A new index, the glucose-to-glycated hemoglobin ratio (GAR), has been developed for assessing stress hyperglycemia. We retrospectively analyzed data from a prospectively collected database of consecutive patients admitted to the Udine University Hospital with AIS that were treated with IVT from January 2015 to December 2019. Four hundred and fourteen consecutive patients with AIS undergoing IVT entered the study. The patients were then stratified into four groups by quartiles of GAR (Q1–Q4). The higher GAR index was, the more severe stress hyperglycemia was considered. Prevalence of 3 months poor outcome (37.7% for Q1, 34% for Q2, 46.9% for Q3, and 66.7% for Q4, p for trend = 0.001), 3 months mortality (10.5% for Q1, 7.5% for Q2, 11.2% for Q3, and 27.1% for Q4, p for trend = 0.001), and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (0.9% for Q1, 0.9% for Q2, 5.1% for Q3, and 17.7% for Q4, p for trend = 0.001) was significant different among the four groups. AIS patients with severe stress hyperglycemia had a significantly increased risk of 3 months poor outcome (OR 2.43, 95% CI 1.14–5.22, p = 0.02), 3 months mortality (OR 2.38, 95% CI 1.01–5.60, p = 0.04), and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (OR 16.76, 95% CI 2.09–134.58, p = 0.008) after IVT. In conclusion, we demonstrated that stress hyperglycemia, as measured by the GAR index, is associated to worse outcome in AIS patients undergoing IVT. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Acute ischemic stroke; Intravenous thrombolysis; Outcome; Stress hyperglycemia","glucose; glycosylated hemoglobin; adult; aged; analytical parameters; Article; brain hemorrhage; brain ischemia; clinical outcome; disease association; disease severity; female; fibrinolytic therapy; glucose to glycated hemoglobin ratio; hospital mortality; human; hyperglycemia; intravenous thrombolysis; major clinical study; male; National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale; neurologic disease; physiological stress; prediction; predictor variable; prevalence; priority journal; retrospective study; stress hyperglycemia; adverse event; blood; complication; glucose blood level; Italy; mortality; predictive value; procedures; prognosis; risk assessment; severity of illness index; Aged; Blood Glucose; Female; Glycated Hemoglobin A; Humans; Hyperglycemia; Intracranial Hemorrhages; Ischemic Stroke; Male; Mortality; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Predictive Value of Tests; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Severity of Illness Index; Thrombolytic Therapy","","glucose, 50-99-7, 84778-64-3; glycosylated hemoglobin, 9062-63-9; Blood Glucose; Glycated Hemoglobin A","","","","","Bruno, Askiel, Acute blood glucose level and outcome from ischemic stroke, Neurology, 52, 2, pp. 280-284, (1999); Désilles, Jean Philippe, Diabetes mellitus, admission glucose, and outcomes after stroke thrombolysis: A registry and systematic review, Stroke, 44, 7, pp. 1915-1923, (2013); Chen, Rong, Diabetes and Stroke: Epidemiology, Pathophysiology, Pharmaceuticals and Outcomes, American Journal of the Medical Sciences, 351, 4, pp. 380-386, (2016); Melamed, Eldad, Reactive hyperglycaemia in patients with acute stroke, Journal of the Neurological Sciences, 29, 2-4, pp. 267-275, (1976); Mankovsky, Boris N., Cerebrovascular disorders in patients with diabetes mellitus, Journal of Diabetes and its Complications, 10, 4, pp. 228-242, (1996); Su, Yuwen, Usefulness of the plasma glucose concentration-to-HbA1c ratio in predicting clinical outcomes during acute illness with extreme hyperglycaemia, Diabetes and Metabolism, 43, 1, pp. 40-47, (2017); Zhu, Bihong, Stress Hyperglycemia and Outcome of Non-diabetic Patients After Acute Ischemic Stroke, Frontiers in Neurology, 10, (2019); Jauch, Edward C., Guidelines for the early management of patients with acute ischemic stroke: A guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association, Stroke, 44, 3, pp. 870-947, (2013); Powers, William J., Guidelines for the early management of patients with acute ischemic stroke: 2019 update to the 2018 guidelines for the early management of acute ischemic stroke a guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association, Stroke, 50, 12, pp. E344-E418, (2019); Ma, Henry K., Thrombolysis Guided by Perfusion Imaging up to 9 Hours after Onset of Stroke, New England Journal of Medicine, 380, 19, pp. 1795-1803, (2019)","G.

Methods: We fully sequenced 25 genes previously identified in GWASs of PD in a total of 1,039 patients with iRBD and 1,852 controls. The role of rare heterozygous variants in these genes was examined with burden tests. The contribution of biallelic variants was further tested. To examine the potential effect of rare nonsynonymous BST1 variants on the protein structure, we performed in silico structural analysis. Finally, we examined the association of common variants using logistic regression adjusted for age and sex. Results: We found an association between rare heterozygous nonsynonymous variants in BST1 and iRBD (p = 0.0003 at coverage >50× and 0.0004 at >30×), driven mainly by 3 nonsynonymous variants (p.V85M, p.I101V, and p.V272M) found in 22 (1.2%) controls vs 2 (0.2%) patients. All 3 variants seem to be loss-of-function variants with a potential effect on the protein structure and stability. Rare noncoding heterozygous variants in LAMP3 were also associated with iRBD (p = 0.0006 at >30×). We found no association between rare heterozygous variants in the rest of genes and iRBD. Several carriers of biallelic variants were identified, yet there was no overrepresentation in iRBD. Conclusion: Our results suggest that rare coding variants in BST1 and rare noncoding variants in LAMP3 are associated with iRBD. Additional studies are required to replicate these results and to examine whether loss of function of BST1 could be a therapeutic target. © 2020 American Academy of Neurology.","","ADP ribosyl cyclase; ADP-ribosyl cyclase 2; glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchored protein; LAMP3 protein, human; leukocyte antigen; lysosome associated membrane protein; tumor protein; aged; computer simulation; female; genetic database; genetic variation; genetics; genome-wide association study; heterozygote; human; male; middle aged; parasomnia; polysomnography; protein secondary structure; ADP-ribosyl Cyclase; Aged; Antigens, CD; Computer Simulation; Databases, Genetic; Female; Genetic Variation; Genome-Wide Association Study; GPI-Linked Proteins; Heterozygote; Humans; Lysosome-Associated Membrane Glycoproteins; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Proteins; Polysomnography; Protein Structure, Secondary; REM Sleep Behavior Disorder","","ADP-ribosyl Cyclase; ADP-ribosyl cyclase 2; Antigens, CD; GPI-Linked Proteins; LAMP3 protein, human; Lysosome-Associated Membrane Glycoproteins; Neoplasm Proteins","","","National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, NINDS, (U01NS100620); National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, NINDS; Michael J.

In fact, it is considered among the nine technological pillars on which Industry 4.0 is based. In particular, it has received a lot of interest from industries, educational institutions and government agencies. For these reasons, it is necessary to develop and train a specialised workforce and to prepare it for these new opportunities. This work aims to investigate, through the completion of a survey based on a systematic review of the literature, the current state of education and dissemination of educational practices related to the training of young engineers at university on the issues of additive manufacturing and related to Industry 4.0. The results show that the introduction of additive manufacturing education represents an important leverage in the preparation of young engineers who benefit from it both in terms of personal preparation and in terms of learning and refining different skills. However, certain aspects, linked to the need to have adequate equipment and a properly trained teaching staff, should not be overlooked. © 2020, The Author(s).","3D printing; Additive manufacturing; Engineering education; Industry 4.0; Systematic literature review","3D printers; Additives; Industry 4.0; Personnel training; Educational institutions; Government agencies; Innovative technology; Systematic literature review; Systematic Review; Teaching staff; Young engineer; Engineering education","","","","","Università degli Studi di Udine, Uniud","","Additive Manufacturing General Principles Terminology, (2015); Recommendations for Implementing the Strategic Initiative Industrie 4 0, (2013); Kellens, Karel, Environmental Dimensions of Additive Manufacturing: Mapping Application Domains and Their Environmental Implications, Journal of Industrial Ecology, 21, pp. S49-S68, (2017); Saade, Marcella Ruschi Mendes, How has LCA been applied to 3D printing?

Accumulating data on patients with COVID-19-associated stroke have shed light on specificities concerning clinical presentation, neuroimaging findings, and outcome. Such specificities include a propensity towards large vessel occlusion, multi-territory stroke, and involvement of otherwise uncommonly affected vessels. Conversely, small-vessel brain disease, cerebral venous thrombosis, and intracerebral hemorrhage appear to be less frequent. Atypical neurovascular presentations were also described, ranging from bilateral carotid artery dissection to posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), and vasculitis. Cases presenting with encephalopathy or encephalitis with seizures heralding stroke were particularly challenging. The pathogenesis and optimal management of ischemic stroke associated with COVID-19 still remain uncertain, but emerging evidence suggest that cytokine storm-triggered coagulopathy and endotheliopathy represent possible targetable mechanisms. Some specific management issues in this population include the difficulty in identifying clinical signs of stroke in critically ill patients in the intensive care unit, as well as the need for a protected pathway for brain imaging, intravenous thrombolysis, and mechanical thrombectomy, keeping in mind that “time is brain” also for COVID-19 patients. In this review, we discuss the novel developments and challenges for the diagnosis and treatment of stroke in patients with COVID-19, and delineate the principles for a rational approach toward precision medicine in this emerging field. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Cerebrovascular disease; Coagulopathy; Coronavirus; Hemorrhagic stroke; Neurological complications; SARS-CoV-2","angiotensin converting enzyme 2; Article; blood clot lysis; blood clotting disorder; blood vessel occlusion; brain hemorrhage; brain ischemia; carotid artery injury; cerebral sinus thrombosis; cerebrovascular accident; clinical feature; computed tomographic angiography; coronavirus disease 2019; critically ill patient; cytokine storm; diffusion weighted imaging; disease association; encephalitis; endothelial dysfunction; human; infection complication; intensive care unit; mechanical thrombectomy; mortality; neuroimaging; neurological complication; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance; pathogenesis; pathophysiology; personalized medicine; posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome; priority journal; prognosis; risk factor; seizure; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; vasculitis; complication; diagnostic imaging; pathology; virology; COVID-19; Humans; SARS-CoV-2; Stroke","","","","","","","undefined; Delorme, Cecile, COVID-19-related encephalopathy: a case series with brain FDG-positron-emission tomography/computed tomography findings, European Journal of Neurology, 27, 12, pp. 2651-2657, (2020); Zambreanu, Laura, A case of limbic encephalitis associated with asymptomatic COVID-19 infection, Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry, 91, 11, pp. 1229-1230, (2020); Khoo, Anthony, Postinfectious brainstem encephalitis associated with SARS-CoV-2, Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry, 91, 9, pp. 1013-1014, (2020); Gigli, Gian Luigi, Guillain-Barré syndrome in the COVID-19 era: just an occasional cluster?, Journal of Neurology, 268, 4, pp. 1195-1197, (2021); Gigli, Gian Luigi, HLA and immunological features of SARS-CoV-2-induced Guillain-Barré syndrome, Neurological Sciences, 41, 12, pp. 3391-3394, (2020); Morassi, Mauro, Stroke in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection: case series, Journal of Neurology, 267, 8, pp. 2185-2192, (2020); Vogrig, Alberto, Causality in COVID-19-associated stroke: a uniform case definition for use in clinical research, Journal of Neurology, 268, 3, pp. 758-761, (2021); Beyrouti, Rahma, Characteristics of ischaemic stroke associated with COVID-19, Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry, 91, 8, pp. 889-891, (2020); Oxley, Thomas J., Large-vessel stroke as a presenting feature of covid-19 in the young, New England Journal of Medicine, 382, 20, (2020)","A.

Inspired by such experiments, in a binary (Takete/Maluma) response test we presented to sixteen individuals a random sequence of either sonic or silent videos reproducing a smooth and a notched ball rolling down along a rounded or zig-zagged path. Bayesian estimation revealed a credible effect of the zig-zagged path in participants choosing Takete, and an equally strong effect of the notched ball. On the other hand, the silent videos had a negative effect on subjects’ probability of choosing Takete. This means that in absence of auditory feedback, subjects tend to choose Maluma compared to similar situations with sound. Though exploratory, such a result suggests that the auditory modality may have significantly biased the decision toward Takete when our participants were exposed to the audio-visual event. If supported by more extensive tests, this experiment would emphasize the importance of sound in the cognition of audio-visual events eliciting sense of sharpness in humans. ©: © 2021 the Authors.","","Audio acoustics; Audio-visual; Auditory feedback; Auditory modality; Bayesian estimations; Cross-modal; Exposed to; Human motions; Modal response; Motion pattern; Random sequence; Bayesian networks","","","","","","","Maurer, Daphne M., The shape of boubas: Sound-shape correspondences in toddlers and adults, Developmental Science, 9, 3, pp. 316-322, (2006); Ramachandran, Vilayanur Subramanian, Synaesthesia - A window into perception, thought and language, Journal of Consciousness Studies, 8, 12, pp. 3-34, (2001); Crisinel, Anne Sylvie, The sweet taste of maluma': Crossmodal associations between tastes and words, Chemosensory Perception, 5, 3-4, pp. 266-273, (2012); Gallace, Alberto, On the taste of ""Bouba"" and ""Kiki"": An exploration of word-food associations in neurologically normal participants, Cognitive Neuroscience, 2, 1, pp. 34-46, (2011); Seo, Han-Seok, Cross-modal integration between odors and abstract symbols, Neuroscience Letters, 478, 3, pp. 175-178, (2010); Shinohara, Kazuko, Takete and Maluma in action: A cross-modal relationship between gestures and sounds, PLOS ONE, 11, 9, (2016); Koppensteiner, Markus, Shaking takete and flowing maluma.

The purpose of our study was to evaluate efficacy and tolerability of perampanel in this group of epilepsies. Patients were classified into 2 groups based on the presence/absence of a single focal brain lesion on MRI, as epilepsy etiology: 48 subjects were affected by focal lesional epilepsy and 15 by non-focal lesional epilepsy. The retention rate was 76.2% and 53.9% at 12 and 24 months respectively. At 12 months, at least 40% of patients resulted responders, with a significant reduction in seizure frequency (p = 0.01), confirmed at 24 months. Considering epilepsy etiology, we found a better PER response in patients with focal lesional epilepsy. A significant correlation was observed between responder rates and EEG pattern. Only 30% of patients reported mild-moderate adverse events. Efficacy and tolerability of PER, in our study, are in line with the results reported in other real-world studies. Our data suggest the possibility of better PER response in patients with focal brain lesions, which indicates that this drug could be a therapeutic option in this population. © 2020 The Author(s)","AMPA receptors; Brain lesion; Efficacy; Perampanel; Real-world data; Seizures","perampanel; add on therapy; adult; aged; Article; correlation analysis; dizziness; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug tolerability; drug withdrawal; electroencephalogram; epilepsy; experience; female; follow up; human; major clinical study; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; observational study; priority journal; psychomotor disorder; rash; retrospective study; treatment response","","perampanel, 380917-97-5","","","","","Duncan, John S., Adult epilepsy, The Lancet, 367, 9516, pp. 1087-1100, (2006); Vossler, David G., CURRENT REVIEW IN CLINICAL SCIENCE, Epilepsy Currents, 18, pp. 1-26, (2018); Brodie, Martin J., Patterns of treatment response in newly diagnosed epilepsy, Neurology, 78, 20, pp. 1548-1554, (2012); Beghi, Ettore, The natural history and prognosis of epilepsy, Epileptic Disorders, 17, 3, pp. 243-253, (2015); French, Jacqueline A., Adjunctive perampanel for refractory partial-onset seizures: Randomized phase III study 304, Neurology, 79, 6, pp. 589-596, (2012); Krauss, Gregory L., Randomized phase III study 306 Adjunctive perampanel for refractory partial-onset seizures, Neurology, 78, 18, pp. 1408-1415, (2012); French, Jacqueline A., Evaluation of adjunctive perampanel in patients with refractory partial-onset seizures: Results of randomized global phase III study 305, Epilepsia, 54, 1, pp. 117-125, (2013); French, Jacqueline A., Perampanel for tonic-clonic seizures in idiopathic generalized epilepsy, Neurology, 85, 11, pp. 950-957, (2015); Steinhoff, Bernhard Jochen, A multicenter survey of clinical experiences with perampanel in real life in Germany and Austria, Epilepsy Research, 108, 5, pp. 986-988, (2014); Rohracher, Alexandra, Two-year real-world experience with perampanel in patients with refractory focal epilepsy: Austrian data, Therapeutic Advances in Neurological Disorders, 9, 6, pp. 445-453, (2016)","A.

Treatment of narcolepsy remains challenging and current therapy is strictly symptomatically based. Areas covered: The present manuscript is based on an extensive Internet and PubMed search from 1990 to 2020. It is focused on the clinical and pharmacological properties of pitolisant in the treatment of narcolepsy. Expert opinion: Currently there is no cure for narcolepsy. Although efforts have been made, current treatments do not always allow to obtain an optimal control of symptoms. Pitolisant is an antagonist/inverse agonist of the histamine H3 autoreceptor. Its mechanism of action is novel and distinctive compared to the other available therapies for narcolepsy. Clinical trials suggest that pitolisant administered at a dose of ≤36 mg/day is an effective treatment option for narcolepsy, reducing EDS and cataplexy. Pitolisant is available as oral tablets and offers a convenient once-daily regimen. Pitolisant is generally well tolerated and showed minimal abuse potential in animals and humans. Long-term studies comparing the effectiveness and tolerability of pitolisant with active drugs (e.g. modafinil, sodium oxybate) are needed. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Cataplexy; excessive daytime sleepiness; histamine; hypocretin; narcolepsy; pitolisant","histamine H3 receptor; modafinil; oxybate sodium; pitolisant; piperidine derivative; abdominal discomfort; abdominal pain; anxiety; apathy; Article; body weight disorder; body weight gain; cataplexy; comparative effectiveness; depression; diarrhea; drug efficacy; drug interaction; drug mechanism; drug tolerability; drug withdrawal; excessive daytime sleepiness; headache; human; insomnia; irritability; monotherapy; narcolepsy; nausea; nonhuman; pharmacodynamics; pharmacokinetics; symptom; vertigo; vomiting; animal; comparative study; drug effect; sleep; treatment outcome; Animals; Cataplexy; Humans; Modafinil; Narcolepsy; Piperidines; Sleep; Sodium Oxybate; Treatment Outcome","","modafinil, 68693-11-8; oxybate sodium, 502-85-2; pitolisant, 362665-56-3, 903576-44-3; Modafinil; Piperidines; pitolisant; Sodium Oxybate","","","","","Thorpy, Michael J., Clinical and practical considerations in the pharmacologic management of narcolepsy, Sleep Medicine, 16, 1, pp. 9-18, (2015); Kallweit, Ulf, Pharmacological management of narcolepsy with and without cataplexy, Expert Opinion on Pharmacotherapy, 18, 8, pp. 809-817, (2017); Scammell, Thomas E., Narcolepsy, New England Journal of Medicine, 373, 27, pp. 2654-2662, (2015); Ohayon, Maurice Moyses, Prevalence of narcolepsy symptomatology and diagnosis in the European general population, Neurology, 58, 12, pp. 1826-1833, (2002); Avniel-Aran, Adi Avniel, Clinical and therapeutic aspects of childhood narcolepsy-cataplexy: A retrospective study of 51 children, Sleep, 33, 11, pp. 1457-1464, (2010); Diagnostic and Coding Manual, (2005); Jennum, Poul Jørgen, Health, social, and economic consequences of narcolepsy: A controlled national study evaluating the societal effect on patients and their partners, Sleep Medicine, 13, 8, pp. 1086-1093, (2012); Jennum, Poul Jørgen, The economic consequences of narcolepsy, Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine, 5, 3, pp. 240-245, (2009); de Biase, Stefano, Important decisions in choosing the pharmacotherapy for narcoleptics, Expert Opinion on Pharmacotherapy, 20, 5, pp. 483-486, (2019); Summary of Product Characteristics, (2025)","G.L.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of GBS in which SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in the CSF, further strengthening the role of the virus as a trigger. In conclusion, our study suggests that SARS-CoV-2 antibodies need to be searched in the serum and CSF in patients with GBS living in endemic areas, even in the absence of a clinically severe COVID-19 infection, and that IL-8 pathway can be relevant in Si-GBS pathogenesis. Further studies are needed to conclude on the relevance of the genetic findings, but it is likely that HLA plays a role in this setting as in other autoimmune neurological syndromes, including those triggered by infections. © 2020, Fondazione Società Italiana di Neurologia.","Coronavirus; Covid-19; Cytokines; Guillain-Barré syndrome; Interleukin-6; Interleukin-8; Neurological complications; Neurology; Polyradiculoneuropathy","albumin; HLA A3 antigen; hla a33 antigen; HLA DRB1 antigen; immunoglobulin; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; SARS-CoV-2 antibody; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; autoantibody; autoantigen; cytokine; HLA antigen; virus antibody; adult; allele; areflexia; Article; ataxia; case report; central nervous system; cerebrospinal fluid; cerebrospinal fluid analysis; clinical article; clinical feature; coronavirus disease 2019; diarrhea; fever; flu like syndrome; follow up; gait; genetic predisposition; Guillain Barre syndrome; HLA system; human; hyporeflexia; male; medical history; middle aged; nerve conduction; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; paresthesia; protein content; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; thorax radiography; weakness; x-ray computed tomography; Betacoronavirus; complication; Coronavirus infection; genetics; genotype; immunology; pandemic; virology; virus pneumonia; Antibodies, Viral; Autoantibodies; Autoantigens; Coronavirus Infections; Cytokines; Genotype; Guillain-Barre Syndrome; HLA Antigens; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","","immunoglobulin, 9007-83-4; interleukin 8, 114308-91-7; Antibodies, Viral; Autoantibodies; Autoantigens; Cytokines; HLA Antigens","","","","","Morassi, Mauro, Stroke in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection: case series, Journal of Neurology, 267, 8, pp. 2185-2192, (2020); Vogrig, Alberto, Causality in COVID-19-associated stroke: a uniform case definition for use in clinical research, Journal of Neurology, 268, 3, pp. 758-761, (2021); Pilotto, Andrea, Steroid-Responsive Encephalitis in Coronavirus Disease 2019, Annals of Neurology, 88, 2, pp. 423-427, (2020); Toscano, Gianpaolo, Guillain-Barré syndrome associated with SARS-CoV-2, New England Journal of Medicine, 382, 26, pp. 2574-2577, (2020); Willison, Hugh John, Guillain-Barré syndrome, The Lancet, 388, 10045, pp. 717-727, (2016); Rothe, Camilla, Transmission of 2019-NCOV infection from an asymptomatic contact in Germany, New England Journal of Medicine, 382, 10, pp. 970-971, (2020); Meng, Heng, CT imaging and clinical course of asymptomatic cases with COVID-19 pneumonia at admission in Wuhan, China, Journal of Infection, 81, 1, pp. e33-e39, (2020); McGonagle, Dennis G., The Role of Cytokines including Interleukin-6 in COVID-19 induced Pneumonia and Macrophage Activation Syndrome-Like Disease, Autoimmunity Reviews, 19, 6, (2020); Guo, Li, The association between HLA typing and different subtypes of Guillain Barré syndrome, Chinese Journal of Internal Medicine, 41, 6, pp. 381-383, (2002); Hasan, Zaki Noah, Association between human leukocyte antigen-DR and demylinating guillain-barré syndrome, Neurosciences, 19, 4, pp. 301-305, (2014)","A.

The PERG of the University of Udine studied how to exploit the potentialities of new technologies, to enable students to acquire a coherent vision of optical diffraction. The conceptions of students were studied involving them in educational labs on light diffraction and monitoring their learning progressions with inquiry-based learning tutorials. The qualitative data analysis showed that many students developed initial models based on a rectilinear path light propagation, progressively adapted to include the main features of the phenomenology and creating the condition for the construction of a coherent model. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

Project IDIFO6, coordinated by Physics Education Research Unit (PERU) from University of Udine (IT) allowed to respond positively to the request of 25 physics and mathematics secondary school teachers from a network of school from Veneto, proposing them a specific course named MQ_P on modern physics topics. The structure and contents of the course have been designed in a tight cooperation between PERU and the involved teachers, sharing with them topics, teaching sequences, methodologies, and research questions. A setting integrating experiential and situated models in teacher formation allowed participants to experience actively scientific-cultural problems that the introduction of modern physics sets on conceptual plan in designing didactical proposals integrating operative aspects in the form of experimental, interpretative, and problem solving activities. At the end of the course, every participant revised individually the contents addressed and two rubrics guided the planning of the teaching intervention.

The new ways of learning require new methods and active learning able to produce competences and not only knowledge; the laboratory work has to be integrated in every day school activities, as well as the contribution of ICT in the teaching/learning process; the new topics related to the physics of the last century is the main content need. Research is an urgent need in finding ways for integrating modern physics in vertical perspective in the curriculum, by means of new active methods to avoid the reductionist attitude to add not more than notions on special relativity and quantum physics as final topic in the curriculum in informative or narrative way. Modern physics in secondary school is a challenge which involves the possibility to transfer to the future generations a culture in which physics is an integrated part, not a marginal one, involving curricula innovation in a way that allows the students to manage them in moments of organized analysis, in everyday life, in social decisions. In the theoretical framework of the Model of Educational Reconstruction, we developed research-based educational proposals focused on contributions to the practice, developing coherent learning paths in vertical perspective. Design Based Research integrated with research and developments of new tools and studies on conceptual change are carried out to produce learning progression and finding ways to offer opportunities for understanding and experiencing what physics is, what it deals with, and how it works in operative way. Empirical data analysis of student reasoning in intervention modules supports proposed strategies. In this chapter, we present our research methods, we list the main path proposals prepared and implemented, and we describe in detail two of them: cross section and phenomenological approach to the superconductivity. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

About one third of patients treated with available ASMs continue to experience uncontrolled seizures. There is still need for new ASMs with enhanced effectiveness and tolerability. Areas covered: The present manuscript is based on an extensive Internet and PubMed search from 1999 to 2020. It is focused on the clinical and pharmacological properties of brivaracetam (BRV) in the treatment of epilepsy. Expert opinion: BRV is approved as add-on or monotherapy (in US) for the treatment of focal-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization. BRV is a high affinity synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A ligand, with 15–30-fold higher affinity than levetiracetam. The selectivity of BRV may be associated with fewer clinical adverse effects. BRV shares many of the pharmacokinetic characteristics of an ideal ASMs. Additionally, BRV has a low potential for clinically relevant drug–drug interactions. Its pharmacokinetic profile makes BRV a promising agent for the treatment of status epilepticus (SE). Although BRV is not approved for the treatment of SE, it has demonstrated promising preliminary results. Further studies are needed to explore the efficacy and tolerability of BRV in SE. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Absorption; brivaracetam; distribution; elimination; focal-onset seizures; interactions; pharmacokinetic; status epilepticus; toxicology","beta1 integrin; brivaracetam; carbamazepine; carbamazepine 10,11 oxide; lacosamide; lamotrigine; levetiracetam; oxcarbazepine; phenobarbital; phenytoin; pregabalin; topiramate; valproic acid; zonisamide; 2 pyrrolidone derivative; anticonvulsive agent; age; Article; drug absorption; drug distribution; drug efficacy; drug excretion; drug interaction; drug mechanism; drug metabolism; drug safety; drug tolerability; epilepsy; epileptic state; ethnicity; gender; human; kidney failure; lactation; liver failure; pregnancy; seizure; synapse vesicle; animal; focal epilepsy; pathophysiology; Animals; Anticonvulsants; Drug Interactions; Epilepsies, Partial; Humans; Pyrrolidinones; Status Epilepticus","","brivaracetam, 357336-20-0; carbamazepine, 298-46-4, 8047-84-5; carbamazepine 10,11 oxide, 36507-30-9; lacosamide, 175481-36-4; lamotrigine, 84057-84-1; levetiracetam, 102767-28-2; oxcarbazepine, 28721-07-5; phenobarbital, 50-06-6, 57-30-7, 8028-68-0; phenytoin, 57-41-0, 630-93-3; pregabalin, 148553-50-8; topiramate, 97240-79-4; valproic acid, 1069-66-5, 99-66-1; zonisamide, 68291-97-4; Anticonvulsants; brivaracetam; Pyrrolidinones","","","","","Beghi, Ettore, The Epidemiology of Epilepsy, Neuroepidemiology, 54, 2, pp. 185-191, (2020); Shneker, Bassel F., Epilepsy, Disease-a-Month, 49, 7, pp. 426-478, (2003); de Biase, Stefano, Pharmacokinetic drug evaluation of lacosamide for the treatment of partial-onset seizures, Expert Opinion on Drug Metabolism and Toxicology, 13, 9, pp. 997-1005, (2017); Ngugi, Anthony K., Estimation of the burden of active and life-time epilepsy: A meta-analytic approach, Epilepsia, 51, 5, pp. 883-890, (2010); Brodie, Martin J., Patterns of treatment response in newly diagnosed epilepsy, Neurology, 78, 20, pp. 1548-1554, (2012); Marson, Anthony Guy, The SANAD study of effectiveness of carbamazepine, gabapentin, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, or topiramate for treatment of partial epilepsy: an unblinded randomised controlled trial, The Lancet, 369, 9566, pp. 1000-1015, (2007); de Biase, Stefano, Timing use of novel anti-epileptic drugs: is earlier better?, Expert Review of Neurotherapeutics, 19, 10, pp. 945-954, (2019); Briviact ® Brivaracetam Highlights of Prescribing Information; Summary of Product Characteristics, (2025); Klitgaard, Henrik V., Brivaracetam: Rationale for discovery and preclinical profile of a selective SV2A ligand for epilepsy treatment, Epilepsia, 57, 4, pp. 538-548, (2016)","G.L.

The aim of this study was to investigate the association between these sleep complaints and the risk of long-term (20 years) all-cause mortality in older adults. Between April 2000 and March 2001, 750 subjects aged 65 years and older, who resided in the seventh district of Udine, were recruited. Data on sociodemographic characteristics, past medical history, and pharmacological treatment were collected. Dementia was diagnosed using a comprehensive neurological and neuroradiological assessment. Older adults were interviewed by neuropsychologists trained in sleep disturbances in order to assess the presence of sleep complaints. Vital status was followed over 20 years until March 2020. Older male adults affected by insomnia and EDS were significantly more likely to die over the follow-up period. Indeed, males reporting poor sleep and daytime somnolence had a 60% and 48% higher chance of dying than subjects who were not affected by these sleep complaints, respectively. The HR was attenuated after adjusting for confounding variables among insomniacs, whereas that of somnolent men strengthened. Differently from men, insomnia and EDS did not have any impact on mortality in older women. In conclusion, older male adults affected by insomnia and EDS had a significant increased risk of mortality, which is independent of cancer, depression, dementia, cardiovascular diseases, and sleeping pill use. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Dementia; Excessive daytime sleepiness; Insomnia; Mortality","aged; all cause mortality; Article; cohort analysis; confounding variable; controlled study; data analysis; daytime somnolence; dementia; demography; female; follow up; geriatric patient; human; information processing; insomnia; Italy; long term care; major clinical study; male; medical history; men's health; mortality; mortality risk; neuroimaging; neurologic disease assessment; population research; prediction; prescription; priority journal; psychological interview; risk factor; sex difference; very elderly","","","","","","","Crowley, Kate E., Sleep and sleep disorders in older adults, Neuropsychology Review, 21, 1, pp. 41-53, (2011); Nakakubo, Sho, Sleep Duration and Excessive Daytime Sleepiness Are Associated With Incidence of Disability in Community-Dwelling Older Adults, Journal of the American Medical Directors Association, 17, 8, pp. 768-768.e5, (2016); Merlino, Giovanni, Daytime sleepiness is associated with dementia and cognitive decline in older Italian adults: A population-based study, Sleep Medicine, 11, 4, pp. 372-377, (2010); Ohayon, Maurice Moyses, Epidemiology of insomnia: What we know and what we still need to learn, Sleep Medicine Reviews, 6, 2, pp. 97-111, (2002); Spiegel, Karine, Effects of poor and short sleep on glucose metabolism and obesity risk, Nature Reviews Endocrinology, 5, 5, pp. 253-261, (2009); Knutson, Kristen L., The metabolic consequences of sleep deprivation, Sleep Medicine Reviews, 11, 3, pp. 163-178, (2007); Miller, Michelle Avril, Inflammation, sleep, obesity and cardiovascular disease, Current Vascular Pharmacology, 5, 2, pp. 93-102, (2007); Meisinger, Christa, Sleep duration and sleep complaints and risk of myocardial infarction in middle-aged men and women from the general population: The MONICA/KORA Augsburg cohort study, Sleep, 30, 9, pp. 1121-1127, (2007); Ikehara, Satoyo, Association of sleep duration with mortality from cardiovascular disease and other causes for japanese men and women: The JACC study, Sleep, 32, 3, pp. 295-301, (2009); Cappuccio, Francesco Paolo, Quantity and quality of sleep and incidence of type 2 diabetes: A systematic review and meta-analysis, Diabetes Care, 33, 2, pp. 414-420, (2010)","G.

Nonetheless, it can also be productively employed in other application areas. This paper presents an assertion-guided program specialization methodology for efficiently imposing safety properties on software systems. The program specializer takes as input a set A of logical assertions that specifies the expected system behavior plus a software system that is modeled as a Maude program R that may violate some of the assertions in A. The outcome is a safe refinement R▹ of R in which every system computation is a good run of R, i.e., it satisfies the assertions in A. The specialization technique has been fully automated in the ÁTAME system and ensures that no good run of R is removed from R▹, while the number of bad runs is reduced to zero. The efficiency and scalability of our technique is empirically demonstrated by means of a thorough experimental evaluation of the ÁTAME system, which shows fast specialization times and good performance of the computed specializations, even for large assertion sets. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Assertions; Maude; Program transformation; Safety properties","","","","","","Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades, MCIU, (RTI2018-094403-B-C32); European Commission, EC; Generalitat Valenciana, GVA, (APOSTD/2019/127, PROMETEO/2019/098); European Regional Development Fund, FEDER","This work has been partially supported by the EU (FEDER) and the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities under grant RTI2018-094403-B-C32, and by Generalitat Valenciana ref.

GBA was fully sequenced using molecular inversion probes and Sanger sequencing. We analyzed the effects of GBA variants on the risk of iRBD, age at onset (AAO), and conversion rates.ResultsGBA variants were found in 9.5% of patients with iRBD compared to 4.1% of controls (odds ratio, 2.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.87-3.22; p = 1 × 10-10). The estimated OR for mild p.N370S variant carriers was 3.69 (95% CI, 1.90-7.14; p = 3.5 × 10-5), while for severe variant carriers it was 17.55 (95% CI, 2.11-145.9; p = 0.0015). Carriers of severe GBA variants had an average AAO of 52.8 years, 7-8 years earlier than those with mild variants or noncarriers (p = 0.029). Of the GBA variant carriers with available data, 52.5% had converted, compared to 35.6% of noncarriers (p = 0.011), with a trend for faster conversion among severe GBA variant carriers. However, the results on AAO and conversion were based on small numbers and should be interpreted with caution.ConclusionsGBA variants robustly and differentially increase the risk of iRBD. The rate of conversion to neurodegeneration is also increased and may be faster among severe GBA variant carriers, although confirmation will be required in larger samples. Screening for RBD in healthy carriers of GBA variants should be studied as a potential way to identify GBA variant carriers who will develop a synucleinopathy in the future. © American Academy of Neurology.","","GBA protein, human; glucosylceramidase; aged; clinical trial; degenerative disease; disease exacerbation; female; genetic predisposition; genetic variation; genetics; human; male; middle aged; multicenter study; onset age; parasomnia; Age of Onset; Aged; Disease Progression; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genetic Variation; Glucosylceramidase; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neurodegenerative Diseases; REM Sleep Behavior Disorder","","glucosylceramidase, 37228-64-1; GBA protein, human; Glucosylceramidase","","","Canadian Glycomics Network, GlycoNet; UCB Pharma; Mayo Clinic; H.

However, studies comparing lamotrigine to other, first-line prophylactic agents solely involving patients suffering from migraine with aura are still lacking. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of lamotrigine and topiramate for the preventive treatment of migraine with aura. Methods Fifty-three patients suffering from migraine with aura treated with lamotrigine or topiramate for at least 6 months were included. Pre- and post-treatment clinical data regarding monthly aura frequency and duration, monthly migraine frequency, days of headache and rescue medication used per month were collected. Results Responder rates were similar between the two treatment groups at 6-month follow-up. Interestingly, responder rates for aura frequency and duration were higher in the lamotrigine group compared with the topiramate group (88% vs 79% and 73% vs 54%). Moreover, 50% of the lamotrigine-treated patients reported a complete disappearance of migraine aura compared with 37% of topiramate-treated patients.

The responsible pathogen is named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). The clinical spectrum ranges from asymptomatic infection to severe pneumonia, leading to intensive care unit admission. Evidence of cerebrovascular complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 is limited. We herein report six patients who developed acute stroke during COVID-19 infection. Methods: A retrospective case series of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on nasopharyngeal swabs, who developed clinical and neuroimaging evidence of acute stroke during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: Six patients were identified (5 men); median age was 69 years (range 57–82). Stroke subtypes were ischemic (4, 67%) and hemorrhagic (2, 33%). All patients but one had pre-existing vascular risk factors. One patient developed encephalopathy prior to stroke, characterized by focal seizures and behavioral abnormalities. COVID-19-related pneumonia was severe (i.e., requiring critical care support) in 5/6 cases (83%). Liver enzyme alteration and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) elevation were registered in all cases. Four patients (67%) manifested acute kidney failure prior to stroke. Four patients (67%) had abnormal coagulation tests. The outcome was poor in the majority of the patients: five died (83%) and the remaining one (17%) remained severely neurologically affected (mRS: 4). Conclusions: Both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke can complicate the course of COVI-19 infection. In our series, stroke developed mostly in patients with severe pneumonia and multiorgan failure, liver enzymes and LDH were markedly increased in all cases, and the outcome was poor. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Brain hemorrhage; Cerebrovascular disease; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Encephalitis; Neurological complications","acetylsalicylic acid; aspartate aminotransferase; bilirubin; C reactive protein; clopidogrel; creatinine; D dimer; enalapril; enoxaparin; gamma glutamyltransferase; hydrochlorothiazide; hydroxyurea; lactate dehydrogenase; levetiracetam; metformin; ramipril; telmisartan; warfarin; acute heart infarction; acute kidney failure; acute lung injury; adult; adult respiratory distress syndrome; aged; antihypertensive therapy; aortic valve replacement; Article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; bilirubin blood level; blood clotting test; brain disease; brain hemorrhage; brain ischemia; carotid endarterectomy; case report; cerebrovascular accident; clinical article; computed tomographic angiography; coronavirus disease 2019; creatinine blood level; diabetes mellitus; diffusion weighted imaging; dual antiplatelet therapy; electroencephalogram; female; focal epilepsy; gamma glutamyl transferase blood level; Glasgow coma scale; human; hydrocephalus; hypertension; intensive care; kidney failure; lung embolism; magnetic resonance angiography; male; middle aged; middle frontal gyrus; neuroimaging; nose smear; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; outcome assessment; pleura effusion; pneumonia; priority journal; respiratory distress; retrospective study; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; thorax radiography; throat culture; thrombocytopenia; very elderly; Betacoronavirus; complication; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic imaging; fatality; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Coronavirus Infections; Fatal Outcome; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Retrospective Studies; Stroke","","acetylsalicylic acid, 493-53-8, 50-78-2, 53663-74-4, 53664-49-6, 63781-77-1; aspartate aminotransferase, 9000-97-9; bilirubin, 18422-02-1, 635-65-4; C reactive protein, 9007-41-4; clopidogrel, 113665-84-2, 120202-66-6, 90055-48-4, 94188-84-8; creatinine, 19230-81-0, 60-27-5; enalapril, 75847-73-3; enoxaparin, 679809-58-6; gamma glutamyltransferase, 85876-02-4; hydrochlorothiazide, 58-93-5; hydroxyurea, 127-07-1; lactate dehydrogenase, 9001-60-9; lactate dehydrogenase A; levetiracetam, 102767-28-2; metformin, 1115-70-4, 657-24-9; ramipril, 87333-19-5; telmisartan, 144701-48-4; warfarin, 129-06-6, 2610-86-8, 3324-63-8, 5543-58-8, 81-81-2","","","","","Covid 19 Map, (2020); Chen, Nanshan, Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study, The Lancet, 395, 10223, pp. 507-513, (2020); Guan, Weijie, Clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 in China, New England Journal of Medicine, 382, 18, pp. 1708-1720, (2020); Wang, Dawei, Clinical Characteristics of 138 Hospitalized Patients with 2019 Novel Coronavirus-Infected Pneumonia in Wuhan, China, JAMA, 323, 11, pp. 1061-1069, (2020); Umapathi, Thirugnanam N., Large artery ischaemic stroke in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Journal of Neurology, 251, 10, pp. 1227-1231, (2004); Khosravani, Houman, Protected Code Stroke: Hyperacute Stroke Management During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic, Stroke, 51, 6, pp. 1891-1895, (2020); Mortelliti, Michael P., Acute respiratory distress syndrome, American Family Physician, 65, 9, pp. 1823-1830, (2002); Arabi, Yaseen M., Severe neurologic syndrome associated with Middle East respiratory syndrome corona virus (MERS-CoV), Infection, 43, 4, pp. 495-501, (2015); Lancet, (2020); Emsley, Hedley CA, Acute ischaemic stroke and infection: recent and emerging concepts, The Lancet Neurology, 7, 4, pp. 341-353, (2008)","M.

We use a plane-wave density functional theory Hamiltonian and show that a judicious choice of the reduced basis set can effectively suppress the potentially thorny problem of the unphysical solutions. Our methodology enables ab initio transport simulations with a huge reduction of the size of the problem compared to the original ab initio formulation. Moreover, the approach can also be used for local and nonlocal empirical pseudopotential Hamiltonians, thus promising a wide range of possible applications. We report results for ab initio simulations of MoS2 field effect transistors, where the transport and electrostatics equations are solved self-consistently for channel lengths up to about 20 nanometers. The simulation results rapidly converge with the size of the basis set, so that the blocks of the Hamiltonian matrix can be reduced to a size below 100. Our methodology is a viable approach for ab initio and semiempirical quantum transport simulations and, in particular, it offers an alternative to the use of maximally localized Wannier functions. © 2020 American Physical Society.","","Density functional theory; Field effect transistors; Layered semiconductors; Molybdenum compounds; Quantum chemistry; Sulfur compounds; Ab initio simulations; Empirical pseudo-potential; First principles; Hamiltonian matrix; Quantum transport simulations; Transport modeling; Transport simulation; Wannier functions; Hamiltonians","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (824143); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; European Commission, EC","P.G. acknowledges support by the European Union via the H2020-INFRAEDI-2018-1 project MaX “Materials Design at the Exascale.

This disorder is caused by loss-of-function alterations of NR2F1 (i.e., either whole gene deletions or single nucleotide variants) and, to date, 40 patients have been identified with deletions or mutations in this gene. Here we describe two monozygotic twins harboring a de novo missense variant in the DNA-binding domain of NR2F1 (c.313G>A, p.Gly105Ser), with well-characterized features associated to BBSOAS. Methods: Patients’ DNA was analyzed by exome sequencing identifying the missense variant c.313G>A in NR2F1 (NM_005654.4). Furthermore, molecular modeling was performed to evaluate putative differences in DNA binding between wild-type and mutated NR2F1. Results: The missense variant is predicted to be likely pathogenetic following the ACMG (American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics)/AMP (Association for Molecular Pathology) guidelines. Indeed, dynamic simulation experiments highlighted that the Gly105Ser substitution let the formation of a hydrogen bond between the S105 side chain and R142 and a base (G5) of the DNA sequence, allowing us to hypothesize that the G105 residue might be evolutionary conserved due to the absence of a side chain, besides glycine conformational features. Therefore, the G105S variation seems to cause a stiffening and a possible deformation in the protein-DNA complex due to the interaction of residues R142-S105 and G5 on the DNA, compared to the wild-type. Conclusion: In summary, we described two monozygotic twins harboring a novel Gly105Ser mutation in NR2F1 DNA binding domain, displaying the classical phenotype of BBSOAS-affected patients. Our computational data suggest a dominant negative effect of this newly characterized missense variant. To date, this is the first genetic report analyzing in silico structural consequences of NR2F1 Gly105Ser substitution. © 2020 The Authors.

We discuss the design and implementation of a scalable tool for the analysis and design of applications involving video based networked interaction or teleoperation, such as remotely operated devices and collaborative environments. The tool is intended for providing an accurate measure of the video lag involved in the encoding and streaming of video over packet networks, and for assessing the impact that delays in the video communication has in terms of human performance. The system is demonstrated through two different tasks: first, the measurement of video end-to-end delay for different networking configurations.

Since hyperglycemia in AIS represents a dynamic condition, we tested whether the dynamic patterns of hyperglycemia, defined as blood glucose levels > 140 mg/dl, affect outcomes in these patients. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed data of 200 consecutive patients with prospective follow-up. Based on blood glucose level, patients were distinguished into 4 groups: (1) persistent normoglycemia; (2) hyperglycemia at baseline only; (3) hyperglycemia at 24-h only; and (4) persistent (at baseline plus at 24-h following MT) hyperglycemia. Results: AIS patients with persistent hyperglycemia have a significantly increased risk of poor functional outcome (OR 6.89, 95% CI 1.98–23.94, p = 0.002, for three-month poor outcome; OR 11.15, 95% CI 2.99–41.52, p = 0.001, for no major neurological improvement), mortality (OR 5.37, 95% CI 1.61–17.96, p = 0.006, for in-hospital mortality; OR 4.43, 95% CI 1.40–13.97, p = 0.01, for three-month mortality), and hemorrhagic transformation (OR 6.89, 95% CI 2.35–20.21, p = 0.001, for intracranial hemorrhage; OR 5.42, 95% CI 1.54–19.15, p = 0.009, for symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage) after endovascular treatment. These detrimental effects were partially confirmed after also excluding diabetic patients. The AUC-ROC showed a very good performance for predicting three-month poor outcome (0.76) in-hospital mortality (0.79) and three-month mortality (0.79). Conclusions: Our study suggests that it is useful to perform the prolonged monitoring of glucose levels lasting 24-h after MT. © 2020 by the authors.

Recent clinical trials have suggested a possible association between idelalisib treatment and development of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) due to John Cunningham virus (JCV) reactivation. Nevertheless, clinical course and radiological and pathological features of idelalisib-induced PML still need to be clarified. We provide here the first clinicopathological description of idelalisib-associated PML in a patient who developed epilepsia partialis continua (EPC) as the first manifestation of the disease. Since EPC could present without electroencephalogram alterations, it is crucial to recognize the clinical features of this epileptic condition. EPC is characterized by the presence of repetitive, irregular, clonic jerking, often associated with hemiparesis and involvement of distal rather than proximal muscle groups. Moreover, we highlight the importance of brain biopsy in selected cases when there is a high clinical suspicion of PML, despite negative JCV testing in the cerebrospinal fluid. The pathological finding of prominent inflammatory infiltrate observed here was consistent with a diagnosis of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). IRIS is often associated with PML as a paradoxical worsening of clinical symptoms due to an overreacting immune response, in the context of previous immunosuppression. The unprecedented pathologic observation of IRIS in idelalisib-associated PML provides further insights into the pathogenesis of this rare neurological side effect. © 2019, Journal of NeuroVirology, Inc.","Epilepsia partialis continua; Epilepsy; Idelalisib; Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome; Pathology; Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy","bendamustine; carmustine; cyclophosphamide; cytarabine; etoposide; idelalisib; mefloquine; melphalan; mirtazapine; ofatumumab; rituximab; antineoplastic agent; purine derivative; quinazolinone derivative; adult; anosognosia; arm weakness; Article; ataxic gait; autologous stem cell transplantation; brain biopsy; brain radiography; case report; cerebrospinal fluid analysis; chronic lymphatic leukemia; clinical article; clinical feature; colitis; drug dose reduction; drug eruption; drug withdrawal; electroencephalogram; epileptic state; female; hemianopia; hemiparesis; human; human tissue; immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome; inflammatory infiltrate; JC virus; lymph follicle; middle aged; monotherapy; neurologic disease; neurologic examination; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy; drug effect; growth, development and aging; pathogenicity; pathology; virology; virus activation; Antineoplastic Agents; Epilepsia Partialis Continua; Female; Humans; Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome; JC Virus; Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell; Leukoencephalopathy, Progressive Multifocal; Middle Aged; Purines; Quinazolinones; Virus Activation","","bendamustine, 16506-27-7, 3543-75-7; carmustine, 154-93-8; cyclophosphamide, 50-18-0; cytarabine, 147-94-4, 69-74-9; etoposide, 33419-42-0, 433304-61-1; idelalisib, 1146702-54-6, 870281-82-6; mefloquine, 51773-92-3, 53230-10-7; melphalan, 148-82-3; mirtazapine, 61337-67-5; ofatumumab, 679818-59-8; rituximab, 174722-31-7; Antineoplastic Agents; idelalisib; Purines; Quinazolinones","","","","","Alflen, Astrid, Idelalisib impairs TREM-1 mediated neutrophil inflammatory responses, Scientific Reports, 8, 1, (2018); Alstadhaug, Karl Bjørnar, Treatment of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy with interleukin 7, JAMA Neurology, 71, 8, pp. 1030-1035, (2014); Andriuta, Daniela, Teaching Neuro Images: Epilepsia partialis continua revealing PML after allogenic stem cell transplantation, Neurology, 85, 5, pp. e53-e54, (2015); Bauer, Jan, Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), Acta Neuropathologica, 130, 6, pp. 751-764, (2015); Berciano Blanco, José Ángel, Epilepsia partialis continua in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy: A motor cortex isolation syndrome, Movement Disorders, 18, 12, pp. 1559-1564, (2003); Berger, Joseph Robert, PML diagnostic criteria: Consensus statement from the AAN neuroinfectious disease section, Neurology, 80, 15, pp. 1430-1438, (2013); Bien, Christian G., Epilepsia partialis continua: Semiology and differential diagnoses, Epileptic Disorders, 10, 1, pp. 3-7, (2008); Brigo, Francesco, Probable dysimmune epilepsia partialis continua manifesting as epileptic moving toes syndrome: electroclinical features of a challenging case, Epileptic Disorders, 20, 4, pp. 301-312, (2018); Cockerell, Oliver Charles, Clinical and physiological features of epilepsia partialis continua: Cases ascertained in the UK, Brain, 119, 2, pp. 393-407, (1996); Ferrari, Sergio, HIV-associated PML presenting as epilepsia partialis continua, Journal of the Neurological Sciences, 161, 2, pp. 180-184, (1998)","A.

It is becoming more and more important to investigate formalisms and tools that would allow us to exploit automated reasoning in these domains. An area that has received increasing attention is the use of multi-agent systems which allow an agent to reason about the knowledge and beliefs of other agents. This type of reasoning, i.e., about agents' perception of the world and also about agents' knowledge of her and others' knowledge, is referred to as epistemic reasoning. This paper presents an updated formalization and implementation of a multi-agent epistemic planner, called EFP. In particular, the paper explores the advantages of using alternative state representations that deviate from the commonly used Kripke structures. The paper explores such alternatives in the context of an action language for multi-agent epistemic planning. The paper presents also an actual implementation of a planner that uses the novel ideas, demonstrating concrete performance improvements on benchmarks collected from the literature. © © 2020, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

Despite growing interest for possible applications, the very existence of negative capacitance is still actively debated, even because experimental results for ferroelectric capacitors with or without a metal interlayer led to quite contradicting indications. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of NC operation in ferroelectric capacitors and provide new insights into the discrepancies observed in experiments. Our models duly account for the three-dimensional nature of the problem and show a good agreement with several aspects of recent experiments. Our results also demonstrate that traps at the ferroelectric-dielectric interface play an important role in the feasibility of stable negative capacitance operation in ferroelectric capacitors. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","","Capacitance; Ferroelectric devices; Ferroelectricity; Comprehensive analysis; Dielectric interface; Ferroelectric capacitors; Metal interlayers; Nanoscale electronic devices; Negative capacitance; Technological applications; Ferroelectric materials; article; feasibility study","","","","","","","Salahuddin, Sayeef, Use of negative capacitance to provide voltage amplification for low power nanoscale devices, Nano Letters, 8, 2, pp. 405-410, (2008); Khan, Asif Islam, On the Microscopic Origin of Negative Capacitance in Ferroelectric Materials: A Toy Model, Technical Digest - International Electron Devices Meeting, 2018-December, pp. 9.3.1-9.3.4, (2018); Wong, Justin C., Negative Capacitance Transistors, Proceedings of the IEEE, 107, 1, pp. 49-62, (2019); Theis, Thomas N., In quest of the next switch: Prospects for greatly reduced power dissipation in a successor to the silicon field-effect transistor, Proceedings of the IEEE, 98, 12, pp. 2005-2014, (2010); Seabaugh, Alan C., Low-voltage tunnel transistors for beyond CMOS logic, Proceedings of the IEEE, 98, 12, pp. 2095-2110, (2010); Krivokapič, Zoran, 14nm Ferroelectric FinFET technology with steep subthreshold slope for ultra low power applications, Technical Digest - International Electron Devices Meeting, pp. 15.1.1-15.1.4, (2018); Kwon, Daewoong, Response speed of negative capacitance FinFETs, Digest of Technical Papers - Symposium on VLSI Technology, 2018-June, pp. 49-50, (2018); Rollo, Tommaso, Energy minimization and kirchhoff's laws in negative capacitance ferroelectric capacitors and MOSFETs, IEEE Electron Device Letters, 38, 6, pp. 814-817, (2017); Rollo, Tommaso, New Design Perspective for Ferroelectric NC-FETs, IEEE Electron Device Letters, 39, 4, pp. 603-606, (2018); Rollo, Tommaso, Influence of interface traps on ferroelectric NC-FETs, IEEE Electron Device Letters, 39, 7, pp. 1100-1103, (2018)","","","Royal Society of Chemistry","","","","","","20403364; 20403372","","","32129361","English","Nanoscale","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081723694"

IVT should be used in patients with mild but nevertheless disabling symptoms. We hypothesize that response to IVT of patients with “mild stroke” may depend on their level of functional dependence (FD) at hospital admission. The aims of our study were to investigate the effect of IVT and to explore the role of FD in influencing the response to IVT. This study was a retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database, including 389 patients stratified into patients receiving IVT (IVT+) and not receiving IVT (IVT−) just because of mild symptoms. Barthel index (BI) at admission was used to assess FD, dividing subjects with BI score < 80 (FD+) and with BI score > 80 (FD−). The efficacy endpoints were the rate of positive disability outcome (DO+) (3-month mRS score of 0 or 1), and the rate of positive functional outcome (FO+) (mRS score of zero or one, plus BI score of 95 or 100 at 3 months). At the multivariate analysis, IVT treatment was an independent predictor of DO+ (OR 3.12, 95% CI 1.34−7.27, p = 0.008) and FO+ (OR: 4.70, 95% CI 2.38−9.26, p = 0.001). However, FD+ IVT+ patients had a significantly higher prevalence of DO+ and FO+ than those FD+ IVT–. Differently, IVT treatment did not influence DO+ and FO+ in FD– patients. In FD+ patients, IVT treatment represented the strongest independent predictor of DO+ (OR 6.01, 95% CI 2.59–13.92, p = 0.001) and FO+ (OR 4.73, 95% CI 2.29–9.76, p = 0.001). In conclusion, alteplase seems to improve functional outcome in patients with “mild stroke”. However, in our experience, this beneficial effect is strongly influenced by FD at admission. © 2020 by the authors.

Materials and methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients brought to hospital by the emergency service between December 2016 and January 2018 with a stroke code as possible candidates for intravenous thrombolysis and who had already have a previous stroke. Among them, patients admitted for negative symptoms and finally discharged with a diagnosis of SE mimicking stroke were selected and their clinical characteristics collected. All patients underwent routine blood sample analysis, head computed tomography (CT) scan and, when indicated, CT angiography and CT-perfusion imaging of the head. After admission in our stroke unit, an Electroencephalogram (EEG) was performed within 3 h in patients suspected with SE, then classified according to International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classification (2015). Outcome measures were SE duration, antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) administered, mortality at 12 months, Engel scale, and modified Rankin scale (m-RS) at 6 months. A second cohort included those consecutive patients discharged with a true stroke relapse in the same considered time span. Clinical characteristics of these two cohorts were compared using Mann–Whitney test or Student t-test (Confidence Interval (C.I.) 95%, p < 0.05) for continuous variable and Fisher exact test or Pearson-Chi test for dichotomic variables (p < 0.05). Survival rates were calculated, and a Log-Rank test was performed to evaluate differences in survival distribution. Only in the group with SE, m-RS at 6 months and recurrence of SE were also evaluated. Results: Eleven patients were discharged with a diagnosis of SE mimicking stroke and 65 patients with stroke relapse. Temporal lobe localization was significantly more represented in group with SE (p = 0.036) while there was no difference regarding age, sex, and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). The m-RS was significantly higher in patients with hemorrhage relapse, mainly due to the high incidence of amyloid angiopathy in this subgroup. Status epilepticus recurred in 36.4% of patients, presenting with the same clinical features, and most patients (62.5%) achieved a good seizure control at 6 months (Engel scale = 1). A difference in mortality at 12 months (all cause considered) appeared only when distinguishing strokes between ischemic and hemorrhagic (Chi-Square: 10.711, p < 0.005). Discussion and conclusion: Status epilepticus is not infrequent in patients with previous stroke and may present with negative neurological symptoms, thus mimicking a stroke recurrence. EEG should be considered as a potential diagnostic tool in the acute stroke setting, at least in patients with previous stroke.

Conversely, other areas of the plant are not subject to strict safety requirements. Nevertheless, explosions can be triggered in these areas as well, as the present investigation confirms. In the specific case, the production of biogas by anaerobic digestion in a storm-water tank and its infiltration and accumulation into a technical building through a pipe connection caused the explosion of the building itself.

Orgasmolepsy is an uncommon feature of NT1 that has been poorly described in the literature. The prevalence of this condition is unclear, as it is reasonably underreported by patients for embarrassment and not well investigated by physicians. Pitolisant is a novel treatment for narcolepsy, effective on excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy by modulating the histaminergic system. Real-world data collection on pitolisant efficacy and safety is still ongoing. However, pitolisant effectiveness on orgasmolepsy in NT1 has no precedent in the literature. Orgasmolepsy and other sexual disturbances should be actively searched in narcoleptic patients and, if present, may guide clinicians to prefer pitolisant or sodium oxybate, avoiding antidepressants for their possible sexual side effects. © 2020 Pellitteri et al.","Cataplexy; Narcolepsy treatment; NT1; Sexual dysfunction","","","","","","","","Diagnostic and Coding Manual, (2005); Bassetti, Claudio L.A., Narcolepsy — clinical spectrum, aetiopathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment, Nature Reviews Neurology, 15, 9, pp. 519-539, (2019); Vignatelli, Luca, Red Flags for early referral of people with symptoms suggestive of narcolepsy: a report from a national multidisciplinary panel, Neurological Sciences, 40, 3, pp. 447-456, (2019); de Biase, Stefano, Evaluating pitolisant as a narcolepsy treatment option, Expert Opinion on Pharmacotherapy, 22, 2, pp. 155-162, (2021); Poryazova, Rositsa Neumann, Weak with sex: Sexual intercourse as a trigger for cataplexy, Journal of Sexual Medicine, 6, 8, pp. 2271-2277, (2009); Dauvilliers, Yves A., Cataplexy - Clinical aspects, pathophysiology and management strategy, Nature Reviews Neurology, 10, 7, pp. 386-395, (2014); Dos Santos Coelho, Fernando Morgadinho, Sexual hypnagogic hallucinations and narcolepsy with cataplexy: A case report, Sleep Science, 4, 3, pp. 110-112, (2011); Szûcs, Anna, Misleading hallucinations in unrecognized narcolepsy, Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica, 108, 4, pp. 314-317, (2003); Rothfeld, Jakób, Affektiver Tonus- und Bewußtseinsverlust beim Lachen und Orgasmus (Gelo- und Orgasmolepsia), Zeitschrift für die gesamte Neurologie und Psychiatrie, 115, 1, pp. 516-530, (1928); Lam, Siu Ping, Status cataplecticus leading to the obstetric complication of prolonged labor, Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine, 3, 1, pp. 56-57, (2007)","G.

In particular, within this context, interest in Additive Manufacturing – AM is constantly growing. For this reason, the authors have considered as appropriate to carry out a literature search to assess whether there is any relationship between AM processes and product design and development practices after 2011. Particularly, the authors were interested in considering the use of additive technologies in relation to the TRIZ – theory of inventive problem solving - and its tools. To this end, it has been decided to carry out a search among the publications contained in the Scopus Database. 115 potential papers have been identified for analysis. After a careful selection, 14 papers, containing information on AM and TRIZ useful for our survey, were selected. Reading these works, it was possible to identify current research trends related to the use of creative problem solving strategies such as TRIZ and its combined use with AM, ranging from the definition of particular integrated methodologies of product development to the definition of guidelines for Design for AM or technological predictions, the state of the art of current research, highlights possible levers of intervention and potential developments and future trends. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Additive Manufacturing; Industry 4.0; Research trends; TRIZ","Additives; Industrial research; Industry 4.0; Product design; 'current; Design practice; Development practices; Driving forces; Enabling technologies; Literature search; Manufacturing industries; Product design and development; Research trends; TRIZ; 3D printers","","","","","","","Recommendations for Implementing the Strategic Initiative Industrie 4 0, (2013); Industry 4 0 the Future of Productivity and Growth in Manufacturing Industries, (2015); Motyl, Barbara, How will Change the Future Engineers’ Skills in the Industry 4.0 Framework?

We present here the first population-based incidence study and report the clinical spectrum and antibody profile of PNS in a large area in Northeastern Italy. Methods: We performed a 9-year (2009–2017) population-based epidemiological study of PNS in the provinces of Udine, Pordenone and Gorizia, in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region (983,190 people as of January 1, 2017). PNS diagnosis and subgroups were defined by the 2004 diagnostic criteria. Age- and sex-adjusted incidence rates were calculated. Results: We identified 89 patients with a diagnosis of definite PNS. Median age was 68 years (range 26–90), 52% were female. The incidence of PNS was 0.89/100,000 person-years. PNS incidence rates increased over time from 0.62/100,000 person-years (2009–2011), 0.81/100,000 person-years (2012–2014) to 1.22/100,000 person-years (2015–2017). The prevalence of PNS was 4.37 per 100,000. Most common PNS were limbic encephalitis (31%), cerebellar degeneration (28%) and encephalomyelitis (20%). Among antibody (Ab)-positive cases, most frequent specificities included: Yo (30%), Hu (26%), and Ma2 (22%), while the most frequent associated tumors were lung (17%) and breast cancer (16%), followed by lymphoma (12%). PNS developed in 1 in every 334 cancers in our region. Statistically significant associations were observed between cancer type and Ab-specificity (P < 0.001), and between neurological syndrome and Ab-specificity (P < 0.001). Conclusions: This first population-based study found an incidence of PNS that approximates 1/100,000 person-years and a prevalence of 4/100,000. Moreover, the incidence of PNS is increasing over time, probably due to increased awareness and improved detection techniques. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Autoimmune; Encephalitis; Epidemiology; Incidence; Paraneoplastic syndromes; Prevalence","antibody; Hu antibody; ma2 antibody; unclassified drug; yo antibody; adolescent; adult; aged; antibody specificity; Article; breast cancer; cerebellum degeneration; child; clinical feature; encephalomyelitis; epidemiological data; female; human; incidence; infant; Italy; lung cancer; lymphoma; major clinical study; male; paraneoplastic neuropathy; population research; priority journal; immunology; middle aged; neoplasm; prevalence; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Encephalomyelitis; Female; Humans; Incidence; Limbic Encephalitis; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Paraneoplastic Cerebellar Degeneration; Paraneoplastic Syndromes, Nervous System; Prevalence","","","","","","","Darnell, Robert B., Paraneoplastic syndromes involving the nervous system, New England Journal of Medicine, 349, 16, pp. 1543-1554, (2003); Honnorat, Jérǒme, Paraneoplastic neurological syndromes, Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases, 2, 1, (2007); Dalmau, Josep O., Antibody-mediated encephalitis, New England Journal of Medicine, 378, 9, pp. 840-851, (2018); Graus, Francesc, A clinical approach to diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis, The Lancet Neurology, 15, 4, pp. 391-404, (2016); Vogrig, Alberto, Glioblastoma as differential diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis, Journal of Neurology, 265, 3, pp. 669-677, (2018); Graus, Francesc, Recommended diagnostic criteria for paraneoplastic neurological syndromes, Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry, 75, 8, pp. 1135-1140, (2004); Bettini, Mariela, Incidence of Autoimmune Myasthenia Gravis in a Health Maintenance Organization in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Neuroepidemiology, 48, 3-4, pp. 119-123, (2017); Breiner, Ari, Epidemiology of myasthenia gravis in Ontario, Canada, Neuromuscular Disorders, 26, 1, pp. 41-46, (2016); Martinka, Ivan, Epidemiology of Myasthenia Gravis in Slovakia in the Years 1977-2015, Neuroepidemiology, 50, 3-4, pp. 153-159, (2018); Popperud, Trine Haug, Juvenile myasthenia gravis in Norway: A nationwide epidemiological study, European Journal of Paediatric Neurology, 21, 2, pp. 312-317, (2017)","A.

In patients affected by moderate to severe RLS/WED, a pharmacological treatment is mandatory. Areas covered: The present review is based on an extensive Internet and PubMed search from 1996 to 2019. It is focused on drugs currently used and under development (phase III and beyond) for the treatment of RLS/WED. Expert opinion: The drugs currently available for the treatment of the disease do not always allow for obtaining the optimal control of symptoms, in particular in the long-term treatment. Although initially effective, long-term dopaminergic treatment tends to wane over time and augmentation can occur. Updated international guidelines now recommend α2δ calcium channel ligand medications as the initial drug of choice. Oxycodone-naloxone demonstrated a significant and sustained treatment effect for patients with severe RLS/WED insufficiently controlled with previous treatments. Head-to-head trials of different drugs, as well as more studies on nondopaminergic agents and combination therapy, are greatly needed. Monoamine oxidase B inhibitors could be good candidates for the initial treatment of RLS/WED, sparing stronger dopaminergic agents for later stages of the disease. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Augmentation; dopamine; investigational drugs; iron; MAO-B inhibitors; oxycodone-naloxone; restless legs syndrome; α2δ calcium channel ligand","amfebutamone; calcium channel affecting agent; dopamine receptor stimulating agent; gabapentin; gabapentin enacarbil; iron; levodopa; monoamine oxidase B inhibitor; naloxone plus oxycodone; pramipexole; pregabalin; rasagiline; ropinirole; rotigotine; topiramate; vitamin D; calcium channel; tetralin derivative; thiophene derivative; disease control; disease severity; drug efficacy; drug tolerability; evidence based practice; human; Internet; long term care; practice guideline; restless legs syndrome; Review; symptom assessment; treatment planning; chemistry; metabolism; pathology; Calcium Channels; Dopamine Agonists; Gabapentin; Humans; Pramipexole; Pregabalin; Restless Legs Syndrome; Tetrahydronaphthalenes; Thiophenes; Topiramate","","amfebutamone, 31677-93-7, 34911-55-2; gabapentin, 60142-96-3; gabapentin enacarbil, 478296-72-9; iron, 14093-02-8, 53858-86-9, 7439-89-6; levodopa, 59-92-7; pramipexole, 104632-26-0, 104632-25-9; pregabalin, 148553-50-8; rasagiline, 136236-51-6, 161735-79-1, 1875-50-9; ropinirole, 91374-21-9; rotigotine, 92206-54-7; topiramate, 97240-79-4; Calcium Channels; Dopamine Agonists; Gabapentin; Pramipexole; Pregabalin; rotigotine; Tetrahydronaphthalenes; Thiophenes; Topiramate","","","","","Anguelova, Galia Valentinova, Pharmacologic and Nonpharmacologic Treatment of Restless Legs Syndrome, Sleep Medicine Clinics, 13, 2, pp. 219-230, (2018); Montplaisir, Jacques Yves, Clinical, polysomnographic, and genetic characteristics of restless legs syndrome: A study of 133 patients diagnosed with new standard criteria, Movement Disorders, 12, 1, pp. 61-65, (1997); Ohayon, Maurice Moyses, Epidemiology of restless legs syndrome: A synthesis of the literature, Sleep Medicine Reviews, 16, 4, pp. 283-295, (2012); Bassetti, Claudio L.A., Restless legs syndrome: A clinical study of 55 patients, European Neurology, 45, 2, pp. 67-74, (2001); Earley, Christopher J., Abnormalities in CSF concentrations of ferritin and transferrin in restless legs syndrome, Neurology, 54, 8, pp. 1698-1700, (2000); Gigli, Gian Luigi, Restless legs syndrome in end-stage renal disease, Sleep Medicine, 5, 3, pp. 309-315, (2004); Merlino, Giovanni, Association of restless leqs syndrome in type 2 diabetes: A case-control study, Sleep, 30, 7, pp. 866-871, (2007); Manconi, Mauro, Multicenter case-control study on restless legs syndrome in multiple sclerosis: The REMS Study, Sleep, 31, 7, pp. 944-952, (2008); Manconi, Mauro, Restless legs syndrome and pregnancy, Neurology, 63, 6, pp. 1065-1069, (2004); O'Keeffe, Shaun T., Secondary causes of restless legs syndrome in older people, Age and Ageing, 34, 4, pp. 349-352, (2005)","G.L.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between post-stroke seizures and the risk of long-term disability and mortality in stroke patients. This study is part of a larger population-based study. All patients were prospectively followed up by a face-to-face interview or a structured telephone interview. We enrolled 635 patients with first-ever stroke and without a history of seizures. Prevalence of ischemic stroke (IS) was 85.2%, while the remaining 14.8% of patients were affected by intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). During the study period, 51 subjects (8%) developed post-stroke seizures. Patients with post-stroke seizures were younger, had a higher prevalence of ICH, had a more severe stroke at admission, were more likely to have an IS involving the total anterior circulation, and were more likely to have a lobar ICH than patients without seizures. Moreover, subjects with seizures had more frequently hemorrhagic transformation after IS and cortical strokes. At 24 months, the risk of disability in patients with seizures was almost twice than in those without seizures. However, the negative effect of seizures disappeared in multivariate analysis. Kaplan-Meier survival curves at 12 years were not significantly different between patients with and without post-stroke seizures. Using the Cox multivariate analysis, age, NIHSS at admission, and pre-stroke mRS were independently associated with all-cause long-term mortality. In our sample, seizures did not impair long-term outcome in patients affected by cerebrovascular accidents. The not significant, slight difference in favor of a better survival for patients with seizures may be attributed to the slight age difference between the two groups. © 2019 by the authors.

The goal of pharmacologic therapy remains complete freedom from seizures with minimal side effects. Despite advancements and the development of third-generation antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), a third of patients with epilepsy remain refractory to pharmacotherapy. Areas covered: The present manuscript is based on an extensive Internet and PubMed search from 2004 to 2019. It is focused on the third-generation AEDs (e.g. lacosamide, eslicarbazepine, perampanel, and brivaracetam). Expert opinion: Newer antiepileptic drugs are increasingly used. However, how early in the course of epilepsy third-generations AEDs should be used is still unclear. Third-generation AEDs may offer better tolerability, milder adverse effects, less drug interactions and improved pharmacokinetic characteristics compared to the conventional AEDs. For this reason, the third-generation AEDs may be used earlier and earlier in epileptic patients. Further head-to-head comparisons are needed to determine the exact position of third-generation AEDs relative to conventional AEDs. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Brivaracetam; efficacy; eslicarbazepine; lacosamide; partial-onset seizures; perampanel; pharmacokinetic; primary generalized tonic–clonic seizures; toxicology","anticonvulsive agent; brivaracetam; eslicarbazepine; lacosamide; perampanel; Article; comparative effectiveness; drug efficacy; drug interaction; drug safety; epilepsy; human; hypotension; nonhuman; pharmacodynamics; rash; Anticonvulsants; Epilepsy; Humans","","brivaracetam, 357336-20-0; eslicarbazepine, 104746-04-5; lacosamide, 175481-36-4; perampanel, 380917-97-5; Anticonvulsants","","","","","Fiest, Kirsten M., Prevalence and incidence of epilepsy, Neurology, 88, 3, pp. 296-303, (2017); Younus, Iyan, A resurging boom in new drugs for epilepsy and brain disorders, Expert Review of Clinical Pharmacology, 11, 1, pp. 27-45, (2018); Zeng, Qingyi, Comparative long-term effectiveness of a monotherapy with five antiepileptic drugs for focal epilepsy in adult patients: A prospective cohort study, PLOS ONE, 10, 7, (2015); Ben-Menachem, Elinor, Medical management of refractory epilepsy-Practical treatment with novel antiepileptic drugs, Epilepsia, 55, SUPPL.1, pp. 3-8, (2014); Stephen, Linda J., Antiepileptic drug monotherapy versus polytherapy: Pursuing seizure freedom and tolerability in adults, Current Opinion in Neurology, 25, 2, pp. 164-172, (2012); Brodie, Martin J., Patterns of treatment response in newly diagnosed epilepsy, Neurology, 78, 20, pp. 1548-1554, (2012); Marson, Anthony Guy, The SANAD study of effectiveness of carbamazepine, gabapentin, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, or topiramate for treatment of partial epilepsy: an unblinded randomised controlled trial, The Lancet, 369, 9566, pp. 1000-1015, (2007); Patsalos, Philip N., Drug interactions with the newer antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) - Part 1: Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between AEDs, Clinical Pharmacokinetics, 52, 11, pp. 927-966, (2013); Bialer, Meir, Key factors in the discovery and development of new antiepileptic drugs, Nature Reviews Drug Discovery, 9, 1, pp. 68-82, (2010); Cawello, Willi, Clinical Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Profile of Lacosamide, Clinical Pharmacokinetics, 54, 9, pp. 901-914, (2015)","G.

Between 2009 and 2017, 24 patients received a final diagnosis of PCD. The age-standardized incidence rate of PCD was 0.22/100,000 person-years. Two cases (8.3%) had a stroke-like onset, with an incidence of 0.02/100,000 person-years. Additionally, 10 previously reported stroke-like PCD cases were identified. Among all cases (n = 12), 67% were female; median age was 51 years (range, 22–69). An associated cancer was discovered in all cases. Brain imaging was normal in most (75%) of the patients. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed inflammatory alterations in 73% of the cases. Cancer treatment was more effective than immunotherapy in improving the neurological syndrome. Typical patients with hyperacute PCD are middle-aged women with normal brain imaging, inflammatory markers in CSF, and cancer. Surgery of the underlying cancer is probably the best treatment. PCD must be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute-onset ataxia and/or vertigo. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Ataxia; Differential diagnosis; Epidemiology; Incidence; Paraneoplastic syndromes; Stroke","clonazepam; corticosteroid; immunoglobulin; methylprednisolone; adult; age distribution; aged; Article; ataxia; cancer surgery; cancer therapy; cerebrospinal fluid analysis; cerebrovascular accident; clinical article; female; human; immunotherapy; inflammation; Italy; male; malignant neoplasm; middle aged; multiple cycle treatment; neuroimaging; paraneoplastic neuropathy; plasmapheresis; priority journal; retrospective study; sex difference; standardized incidence ratio; systematic review; vertigo; young adult; diagnostic imaging; differential diagnosis; Diagnosis, Differential; Humans; Paraneoplastic Cerebellar Degeneration; Stroke","","clonazepam, 1622-61-3; immunoglobulin, 9007-83-4; methylprednisolone, 6923-42-8, 83-43-2","","","","","Choi, Jeong-yoon, Central vertigo, Current Opinion in Neurology, 31, 1, pp. 81-89, (2018); Burton, Tina M., Effects of increasing IV tPA-treated stroke mimic rates at CT-based centers on clinical outcomes, Neurology, 89, 4, pp. 343-348, (2017); Nam, Kiwoong, Intravenous thrombolysis in acute ischemic stroke with active cancer, BioMed Research International, 2017, (2017); Weeda, Erin R., Association between comorbid cancer and outcomes among admissions for acute ischemic stroke receiving systemic thrombolysis, International Journal of Stroke, 14, 1, pp. 48-52, (2019); Shireman, Theresa I., Combined anticoagulant-antiplatelet use and major bleeding events in elderly atrial fibrillation patients, Stroke, 35, 10, pp. 2362-2367, (2004); Mitoma, Hiroshi, Consensus Paper: Neuroimmune Mechanisms of Cerebellar Ataxias, Cerebellum, 15, 2, pp. 213-232, (2016); Graus, Francesc, Recommended diagnostic criteria for paraneoplastic neurological syndromes, Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry, 75, 8, pp. 1135-1140, (2004); Anderson, Neil E., Opsoclonus, myoclonus, ataxia, and encephalopathy in adults with cancer: A distinct paraneoplastic syndrome, Medicine (United States), 67, 2, pp. 100-109, (1988); Pradat, Pierre François, Pure cerebellar degeneration associated with anti-Hu antibodies, Revue Neurologique, 151, 5, pp. 341-343, (1995); Bhatia, Rohit, Acute onset paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration in a patient with small cell lung cancer, Neurology India, 51, 2, pp. 244-245, (2003)","A.

Yet, the great request of resources for certain types of problems, as the planning ones, still constitutes a big limitation for problem solving. Particularly, in the case the program is grounded before the resolving phase, an exponential blow up of the grounding can generate a huge ground file, infeasible for single machines with limited resources, thus preventing even the discovering of a single non-optimal solution. To address this problem, in this paper we present a distributed approach to ASP solving, exploiting distributed computation benefits in order to overcome the just explained limitations. The here presented tool, which is called Distributed Answer Set Coloring (DASC), is a pure solver based on the well-known Graph Coloring algorithm. DASC is part of a bigger project aiming to bring logic programming into a distributed system, started in 2017 by Federico Igne with mASPreduce and continued in 2018 by Pietro Totis with a distributed grounder. In this paper we present a low level implementation of the Graph Coloring algorithm, via the Boost and MPI libraries for C++. Finally, we provide a few results of the very first working version of our tool, at the moment without any strong optimization or heuristic. © Marco De Bortoli","","C++ (programming language); Coloring; Computation theory; Computer circuits; Graph theory; Knowledge representation; Logic programming; Optimization; Scheduling algorithms; Answer set programming; Distributed approaches; Distributed computations; Distributed systems; Efficient solvers; Logic languages; Optimal solutions; Single- machines; Distributed computer systems","","","","","","","Adrian, Weronika T., The ASP System DLV: Advancements and Applications, KI - Kunstliche Intelligenz, 32, 2-3, pp. 177-179, (2018); Calimeri, Francesco, Experimenting with parallelism for the instantiation of ASP programs, Journal of Algorithms, 63, 1-3, pp. 34-54, (2008); Dal Palú, Alessandro, GASP: Answer set programming with lazy grounding, Fundamenta Informaticae, 96, 3, pp. 297-322, (2009); Dean, Jeffrey, MapReduce: Simplified data processing on large clusters, Communications of the ACM, 51, 1, pp. 107-113, (2008); Dovier, Agostino, An empirical study of constraint logic programming and answer set programming solutions of combinatorial problems, Journal of Experimental and Theoretical Artificial Intelligence, 21, 2, pp. 79-121, (2009); Dovier, Agostino, Parallel answer set programming, pp. 237-282, (2018); Computing Stable Models in Parallel, (2001); Clingo ASP Control Preliminary Report, (2014); Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Logic Programming, (1990); Analysis and Development of A Distributed ASP Solver Using Mapreduce, (2017)","M.

Maude's symbolic capabilities are based on equational unification and narrowing in rewrite theories, and provide Maude with advanced logic programming capabilities such as unification modulo user-definable equational theories and symbolic reachability analysis in rewrite theories. Intricate computing problems may be effectively and naturally solved in Maude thanks to the synergy of these recently developed symbolic capabilities and classical Maude features, such as: (i) rich type structures with sorts (types), subsorts, and overloading; (ii) equational rewriting modulo various combinations of axioms such as associativity, commutativity, and identity; and (iii) classical reachability analysis in rewrite theories. However, the combination of all of these features may hinder the understanding of Maude symbolic computations for non-experienced developers. The purpose of this article is to describe how programming and analysis of Maude rewrite theories can be made easier by providing a sophisticated graphical tool called Narval that supports the fine-grained inspection of Maude symbolic computations. © 2019 Cambridge University Press.","equational unification; Maude; narrowing; rewriting logic; Symbolic reachability analysis","Computer circuits; Functional programming; High level languages; Logic programming; Equational unification; Maude; narrowing; Rewriting logic; Symbolic reachability analysis; Computation theory","","","","","(RTI2018-094403-B-C32); Air Force Office of Scientific Research, AFOSR, (FA9550-17-1-0286); European Commission, EC; Federación Española de Enfermedades Raras, FEDER; Generalitat Valenciana, (APOSTD/2019/127, PROMETEO/2019/098)","This work has been partially supported by the EU (FEDER) and the Spanish MCIU under grant RTI2018-094403-B-C32, by the Spanish Generalitat Valenciana under grants PROMETEO/2019/098 and APOSTD/2019/127, and by the US Air Force Office of Scientific Research under award number FA9550-17-1-0286.","Alpuente, María, Exploring conditional rewriting logic computations, Journal of Symbolic Computation, 69, 1, pp. 3-39, (2015); Alpuente, María, Assertion-based analysis via slicing with ABETS (system description), Theory and Practice of Logic Programming, 16, 5-6, pp. 515-532, (2016); Alpuente, María, Static correction of Maude programs with assertions, Journal of Systems and Software, 153, pp. 64-85, (2019); Alpuente, María, Inspecting Maude variants with GLINTS, Theory and Practice of Logic Programming, 17, 5-6, pp. 689-707, (2017); Maude Manual Version 2 2, (2005); Clavel, Manuel, All about maude - A high-performance logical framework how to specify, program and verify systems in rewriting logic, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 4350 LNCS, pp. 1-819, (2007); Durán, Francisco, Associative unification and symbolic reasoning modulo associativity in maude, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 11152 LNCS, pp. 98-114, (2018); Escobar, Santiago, Folding variant narrowing and optimal variant termination, Journal of Logic and Algebraic Programming, 81, 7-8, pp. 898-928, (2012); Garavel, Hubert, Benchmarking implementations of term rewriting and pattern matching in algebraic, functional, and object-oriented languages: The 4th rewrite engines competition, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 11152 LNCS, pp. 1-25, (2018); Hähnle, Reiner, A visual interactive debugger based on symbolic execution, pp. 143-146, (2010)","","","Cambridge University Press Journals_subscriptions@cup.cam.ac.uk","","","","","","14710684; 14753081","","","","English","Theory Pract.

Its disciplinary relevance, as well as its importance on the cultural and social levels is widely recognized but few efforts have been made to integrate those aspects in education. Our Physics Education Research Unit from Udine University (Italy) designed an educational method on optical spectroscopy for secondary school students to directly involve them in experimental and interpretative tasks which allow them to highlight the link between energy level in atoms and luminous emission. In the theoretical framework of the Model of Educational Reconstruction, the educational approach involves an analysis of the main conceptual knots on the basis of a significant - if not vast - literature concerning the interpretation of optical spectra. By means of design-based research methods, we designed several intervention modules in which interpretative issues related to the analysis of simple optical spectra from different sources are highlighted using inquiry-based learning strategies. Learning outcomes were monitored by means of empirical research using pre/post-tests and tutorials. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Atomic physics; Education computing; Learning systems; Spectrum analysis; Students; Design-based research; Educational approach; Empirical research; Inquiry-based learning; Light-matter interactions; Luminous emissions; Optical spectroscopy; Theoretical framework; Optical emission spectroscopy","","","","","","","Pos Ffp14, (2014); Computers in Physics, (1998); Zollman, Dean A., Quantum mechanics for everyone: Hands-on activities integrated with technology, American Journal of Physics, 70, 3, pp. 252-259, (2002); Astronomy Education Review, (2007); Chem Educ Res Pract, (2016); undefined, (2012); Ivanjek, Lana, Research as a guide for curriculum development: An example from introductory spectroscopy.

Disabled patients are often excluded from IVT treatment. Previous studies investigated the role of pre-existing disability on outcomes in AIS patients after IVT. However, no studies have been conducted to date to determine whether IVT may improve clinical outcomes in AIS patients with pre-existing disability. The aim of our study was to evaluate efficacy and safety of IVT in patients with pre-existing moderate and moderately severe disability (pre-stroke modified Rankin Scale score = 3 or 4) affected by AIS. This study was based on a retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database of consecutive patients admitted to the Udine University Hospital with AIS from January 2015 to May 2018. The efficacy endpoints were the rate of favorable outcome and rate of major neurological improvement. The safety endpoints were the rate of mortality at three months, presence of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), and presence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH). The study population included 110 AIS patients with pre-existing moderate and moderately severe disability, 36 of which received (IVT+) and 74 did not receive IVT (IVT-). AIS disabled patients treated with IVT had higher rates of favorable outcome (66.7% vs. 36.5%, p = 0.003) and major neurological improvement (39.4% vs. 17.4%, p = 0.01) compared to non-treated ones. Two in three disabled patients returned to their pre-stroke functional status when treated with IVT. Prevalence of three-month mortality, ICH, and sICH did not differ in the two groups. Disabled patients affected by AIS significantly improved after IVT. Moderate and moderately severe disability alone should not be considered, per se, as a contraindication to IVT treatment. © 2019 by the authors.

Despite the increasing number of available antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), approximately one-third of epileptic patients do not have adequate control of seizures. There is still a need for the development of new AEDs with enhanced effectiveness and tolerability. Areas covered: The present manuscript is based on an Internet and PubMed search (January 2005 to August 2018). It is focused on pharmacokinetic and clinical data of perampanel (PER) for the treatment of epilepsy. Expert opinion: PER has a novel mechanism of action, which opens up new options for a rational combination therapy. Phase III trials have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of PER as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial-onset seizures (POS) and primary generalized tonic–clonic seizures in patients aged ≥12 years. PER is also approved by FDA as monotherapy for the treatment of POS. A clinical trial is ongoing to verify the efficacy and safety of PER monotherapy in untreated patients with POS. In the future, head-to-head comparisons are needed to determine the exact position of PER relative to other AEDs. Moreover, further studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PER in patients aged <12 years.Abbreviations: 4βOHC: 4β-hydroxycholesterol; AUC: area under the curve; CBZ: Carbamazepine; CLCr: creatinine clearance; Cmax: maximum plasma concentration; CYP: cytochrome P; EIAED: enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drug; EMA: European Medicines Agency; FDA: Food and Drug Administration; GI: gastrointestinal; OXC: oxcarbazepine; PER: perampanel; PGTC: primary generalized tonic-clonic; PHT: phenytoin; POS: partial-onset seizures; QD: once-daily; TEAE: treatment-emergent adverse event; Tmax: median time to reach peak concentration; UGT: uridine diphosphoglucose-glucuronosyltransferase; VPA: valproic acid. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Absorption; distribution; elimination; partial-onset seizures; perampanel; pharmacokinetic; primary generalized tonic–clonic seizures; toxicology","perampanel; anticonvulsive agent; pyridone derivative; age; area under the curve; Article; clinical study; creatinine clearance; drug absorption; drug bioavailability; drug distribution; drug dose regimen; drug efficacy; drug formulation; drug interaction; drug mechanism; drug safety; drug tolerability; elimination half-life; ethnicity; first pass effect; focal epilepsy; gender; human; Internet; kidney dysfunction; lactation; maintenance drug dose; maximum concentration; maximum plasma concentration; Medline; metabolism; monotherapy; partial onset seizure; pharmacodynamics; pharmacokinetics; phase 3 clinical trial (topic); pregnancy; renal clearance; side effect; tonic clonic seizure; treatment response; animal; child; epilepsy; pathophysiology; seizure; treatment outcome; Animals; Anticonvulsants; Child; Epilepsy; Humans; Pyridones; Seizures; Treatment Outcome","","perampanel, 380917-97-5; pyridone derivative, 694-85-9; Anticonvulsants; perampanel; Pyridones","","","","","de Boer, Hanneke M., The global burden and stigma of epilepsy, Epilepsy and Behavior, 12, 4, pp. 540-546, (2008); Fiest, Kirsten M., Prevalence and incidence of epilepsy, Neurology, 88, 3, pp. 296-303, (2017); Brodie, Martin J., Patterns of treatment response in newly diagnosed epilepsy, Neurology, 78, 20, pp. 1548-1554, (2012); Santulli, Lia, The challenges of treating epilepsy with 25 antiepileptic drugs, Pharmacological Research, 107, pp. 211-219, (2016); Chen, Zhibin, Treatment outcomes in patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy treated with established and new antiepileptic drugs a 30-year longitudinal cohort study, JAMA Neurology, 75, 3, pp. 279-286, (2018); Frampton, James E., Perampanel: A Review in Drug-Resistant Epilepsy, Drugs, 75, 14, pp. 1657-1668, (2015); de Biase, Stefano, Lacosamide for the treatment of epilepsy, Expert Opinion on Drug Metabolism and Toxicology, 10, 3, pp. 459-468, (2014); Bialer, Meir, Key factors in the discovery and development of new antiepileptic drugs, Nature Reviews Drug Discovery, 9, 1, pp. 68-82, (2010); Fycompa ® Perampanel Highlights of Prescribing Information; Summary of Product Characteristics, (2025)","G.L.

This has further pushed the idea of blazar jets being among those cosmic sites where significant neutrino production may take place. We use a procedure based on source-internal electromagnetic cascading to constrain the environments of neutrino-producing sites in photomeson production models of jetted AGN. The role of external photon fields as the dominant target for particle-photon interactions including possible effects of the anisotropic nature of the interactions in the co-moving jet frame is discussed. We apply this procedure to the 2014-15 neutrino spectrum observed by IceCube from TXS 0506+056 to conduct a comprehensive study of these cascade spectra. By comparing these to the simultaneous multi-wavelength emission of this blazar constraints on the environment of the neutrino-emitting region are derived. © Owned by the author(s) under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0).","","Cosmic rays; Cosmology; Gamma rays; Photons; Ice cubes; Multi-wavelength emissions; Neutrino spectrum; Photon fields; Photon interactions; Production models; Neutrons","","","","","(DE-AC02-76SF00515); (64789); U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA; National Research Foundation, NRF; Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, डीएसटी; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, MEXT; Austrian Science Fund, FWF, (I 3452-N27); Centre National dâEtudes Spatiales, CNES; Agenzia Spaziale Italiana, ASI; Instituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare, INFN; Vetenskapsrådet, VR; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, CNRS; Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica, INAF; Department of Science and Technology, Government of Kerala; High Energy Accelerator Research Organization, KEK; Institut National de Physique Nucléaire et de Physique des Particules, IN2P3; Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare, INFN","Funding text 1: A.R. acknowledges financial support from the Austrian Science Fund (FWF), project I 3452-N27.

This paper describes an automated correction methodology for Maude programs that is based on program transformation and can be used to enforce a safety policy, given by a set A of system assertions, in a Maude program R that might disprove some of the assertions. The outcome of the technique is a safe program refinement R' of R in which every computation is a good run, i.e., it satisfies the assertions in A. Furthermore, the transformation ensures that no good run of R is removed from R'. Advantages of this correction methodology can be summarized as follows. • A fully automatic program transformation featuring both program diagnosis and repair that preserves all executability requirements. • A simple logical notation to declaratively express invariant properties and other safety constraints through assertions. • No dynamic information is required to infer program fixes: the methodology is static and does not need to collect any error symptom at runtime. © 2019 The Author(s)","Assertion enforcement; Automated program transformation; Equational rewriting; Maude; Program repair; Rewriting logic; Transformation method for enforcing system invariants in Maude programs","article; assertiveness; logic","","","","","European Commission, EU; Federación Española de Enfermedades Raras, FEDER; Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, MINECO, (RTI2018-094403-B-C32); Generalitat Valenciana, (PROMETEO/2019/098); European Regional Development Fund, FEDER","Funding text 1: This work has been partially supported by the EU (FEDER) and the Spanish MINECO under grant RTI2018-094403-B-C32 , and by Generalitat Valenciana under grant PROMETEO/2019/098 .; Funding text 2: This work has been partially supported by the EU (FEDER) and the Spanish MINECO under grant RTI2018-094403-B-C32, and by Generalitat Valenciana under grant PROMETEO/2019/098.","Alpuente, María, Static correction of Maude programs with assertions, Journal of Systems and Software, 153, pp. 64-85, (2019); Maude Manual Version 2 2, (2005); Clavel, Manuel, All about maude - A high-performance logical framework how to specify, program and verify systems in rewriting logic, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 4350 LNCS, pp. 1-819, (2007); Meseguer, José, Conditional rewriting logic as a unified model of concurrency, Theoretical Computer Science, 96, 1, pp. 73-155, (1992)","M.

Thanks to its popularity, in the last years there has been a great interest towards the developing of efficient solvers, required to deal with complex problems, like planning and NP problem solving. These solvers can be unable to deal with programs that are “grounded” on huge amount of data, possibly resident in different sites. To address this problem, in this paper we present a distributed approach to ASP problems, which involves all the phases of the overall solving process: from a distributed grounder (which can also be used as a solver for stratified programs) to two different techniques to deal with the pure solving phase (for non-stratified program too), both of them using the non-standard graph coloring algorithm to characterize answer sets. We show three proposals for solving the issue, two of them developed with the high-level framework Apache Spark, while the the third one is a C++ direct implementation of the first one. © 2019 CEUR-WS.

Such specificities include seizure-related clinical manifestations as well as the responsiveness to antiepileptic drugs. Although increased enthusiasm accompanies the discovery of novel antibodies and their associated clinical syndromes, several issues remain unsettled. First, it appears that therapy needs to be personalized in the view of the severity of each antibody-mediated syndrome, patient-related characteristics, and timing of treatment. Second, the lack of randomized controlled trials is a major drawback in the formulation of an appropriate immunotherapeutic strategy. In this review, we discuss the novel developments and challenges for the diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy in patients with well-characterized autoimmune encephalitis, and delineate the principles for a rational approach toward precision medicine in this emerging field.

The standard algorithm to find the best possibble move is cubic, both in its worst and average time complexity. Since TSP instances of interest can have thousands of nodes, up to now it has been impossible to use the 3-OPT local search on anything other than quite small instances. In this paper we describe an alternative algorithm whose average complexity appears to be quadratic and which allowed us to use 3-OPT on instances with several thousand nodes. The algorithm is based on a rule for quickly choosing two out of three edges in a good way, and then completing the choice in linear time. To this end, the algorithm uses max-heaps as a suitable data structure. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","3-OPT; Average running time; Local search; OPT; Traveling Salesman Problem","","","","","","","","Local Search in Combinatorial Optimization 1st Edn Wiley Inc, (1997); Traveling Salesman Problem, (2007); Operations Research, (1958); de Berg, Mark T., Fine-grained complexity analysis of two classic TSP variants, Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics, LIPIcs, 55, (2016); Lin, Shen, Computer Solutions of the Traveling Salesman Problem, The Bell System Technical Journal, 44, 10, pp. 2245-2269, (1965); Combinatorial Optimization Algorithms and Complexity, (1998); Reinelt, Gerhard, TSPLIB.

But, for a researcher it could also be interesting to: extract these data in real time in order to create bibliographies, for example, by starting with a small set of significant papers or a restricted number of authors, progressively enriching them by exploring cited/citing references; dispose them in a graphical and aggregate representation; be able to easily share them with other interested researchers. With these main intents, we modelled and realized VisualBib, a Web application prototype, which enables the user to select sets of papers and/or authors in order to create customized bibliographies, and visualize them in real time, aggregating data from different sources in a comprehensive, holistic graphical view. The bibliographies are displayed using time-based visualizations, called narrative views, which contain explicit representations of the authorship and citing relations. These views may help users to: describe a research area; disseminate research on a specific topic and share personal opinions; present or evaluate the entire production of a researcher or research groups in a fresh way. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Graphic organizer; Holistic view; Human computer interaction (HCI); Information visualization; Visual bibliography; Visualization design and evaluation methods","Human computer interaction; Information systems; Paper; Semantics; Visualization; Graphic organizers; Holistic view; Human Computer Interaction (HCI); Information visualization; Visualization designs; Bibliographies","","","","","","","Federico, Paolo, A Survey on Visual Approaches for Analyzing Scientific Literature and Patents, IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, 23, 9, pp. 2179-2198, (2017); Dattolo, Antonina, VisualBib: Narrative views for customized bibliographies, pp. 133-138, (2018); Lee, Bongshin, Understanding research trends in conferences using paperlens, Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings, pp. 1969-1972, (2005); Görg, Carsten, Combining computational analyses and interactive visualization for document exploration and sensemaking in jigsaw, IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, 19, 10, pp. 1646-1663, (2013); D3 Data Driven Documents; Elsevier Developers API Interface Specification; Elsevier Developers API Key Settings, (2018); undefined, (2004); Journal of Usability Studies, (2013); Matejka, Justin, Citeology: Visualizing paper genealogy, Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings, pp. 181-189, (2012)","A.

The program specializer ÁTAME takes as input a set A of system assertions that model the expected program behavior plus a Maude program R to be specialized that might violate some of the assertions in A. The outcome of the tool is a safe program refinement R′ of R in which every computation is a good run, i.e., it satisfies the assertions in A. The specialization technique encoded in is fully automatic and ensures that no good run of R is removed from R′, while the number of bad runs is reduced to zero. We demonstrate the tool capabilities by specializing an overly general nondeterministic dam controller to fulfill a safety policy given by a set of system assertions. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.","Assertions; Maude; Program adaptability; Program specialization; Rewriting logic","Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Assertions; Maude; Program adaptability; Program specialization; Rewriting logic; Computation theory","","","","","","","Alpuente, María, Exploring conditional rewriting logic computations, Journal of Symbolic Computation, 69, 1, pp. 3-39, (2015); Alpuente, María, Partial evaluation of order-sorted equational programs modulo axioms, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 10184 LNCS, pp. 3-20, (2017); Danvy, Olivier, Preface, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1110, pp. v-ix, (1996); Khoo, Siau Cheng, Program adaptation via output-constraint specialization, Higher-Order and Symbolic Computation, 17, 1-2, pp. 93-128, (2004); Meseguer, José, Conditional rewriting logic as a unified model of concurrency, Theoretical Computer Science, 96, 1, pp. 73-155, (1992)","D.

A LD system [8] differs from a learning management system (LMS) [10]: (1) in an LMS the focus is on the organization of a curriculum and on the setting of auxiliary tools to communicate and interact with students; (2) in an LD the focus is on the design of a course or also of a single teaching session, and on building and assembling TLA in order to create effective learning paths for students. On such a platform, a teacher can arrange the activities, attach appropriate contents and be guided in choosing right tools for the students' tasks. An open issue is the lack of a Web tool based on graphic organizers to access in a simple way both micro and macro aspects of the LD. The aim of the research is to model a lightweight tool to be used both by teachers and by students as a support for daily learning activities offering attractive interaction and Web access. © 2017 ACM.","","Curricula; Students; Teaching; Attractive interactions; Computer based tools; Effective learning; Graphic organizers; Learning Activity; Learning designs; Learning management system; Teaching-learning activities; Education","","","","","","","Compendiumld Learning Design, (2017); Curriculum Mapping, (2017); LD Shake A Web2 0 Tool for the Social Sharing and Co Editing of Learning Design Solutions, (2017); LD Tool Learning Design Collection, (2017); Acquisition and Retention of Knowledge A Cognitive View, (2000); LD Inventory Project, (2017); Interact Integrate Impact Proceedings of the 20th Annual Conference of the Australasian Society for Computers in Learning in Tertiary Education, (2003); IEEE 63rd Annual Conference International Council for Educational Media ICEM, (2013); Dattolo, Antonina, A formal description of zz-structures, CEUR Workshop Proceedings, 508, pp. 7-11, (2009); Field Guide to Learning Management Systems, (2009)","M.

Features: explores the interrelationships between sets and graphs and their applications to finite combinatorics; introduces the fundamental graph-theoretical notions from the standpoint of both set theory and dyadic logic, and presents a discussion on set universes; explains how sets can conveniently model graphs, discussing set graphs and set-theoretic representations of claw-free graphs; investigates when it is convenient to represent sets by graphs, covering counting and encoding problems, the random generation of sets, and the analysis of infinite sets; presents excerpts of formal proofs concerning graphs, whose correctness was verified by means of an automated proof-assistant; contains numerous exercises, examples, definitions, problems and insight panels. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.
